<p>You can upload metadata to FromThePage to display on the "About" page for each document/work and then configure faceted browsing for your collection based on that metadata.</p>
<p>The following video will walk you through the process, or you can following along in the documentation below.<br />
<iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bUmfweLC6IE" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, in the settings of your collection, look for the "Metadata" section on the right side.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1118" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2021/05/SettingsTab.png" alt="" width="442" height="374" /></p>
<p>Choose "Upload Metadata" and you'll see the following window.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1119" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2021/05/UploadMetadata.png" alt="" width="660" height="319" /></p>
<p>Download the template file, which has the FromThePage identifier and title for each work in your collection.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1117 size-large" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2021/05/metadataTemplate-1024x736.png" alt="" width="1024" height="736" /></p>
<p>Keep the work_id field and add columns for any metadata fields you'd like to include in FromThePage.  For this example I chose "year", "end year" "document type" and "creator."</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1116" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2021/05/MetadataFilledIn-1024x602.png" alt="" width="1024" height="602" /></p>
<p>Once you've filled out the spreadsheet, upload it in the "Upload Metadata" screen:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1119" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2021/05/UploadMetadata.png" alt="" width="660" height="319" /></p>
<p>Now, if you look at the "About" screen of a document, you'll see the metadata fields you just uploaded with values for that document.  You can use a variety of values your transcribers might want to know, including links to other systems.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1113" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2021/05/AboutTabMetadata.png" alt="" width="849" height="563" /></p>
<p>It's great to have metadata for every document to view, but it's even better to use it for filtering and finding documents.  If you go back to the collection settings you can find the "Metadata Facets" field on the right side.  Click "Enable Facets".</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1118" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2021/05/SettingsTab.png" alt="" width="442" height="374" /></p>
<p>You'll have each of your metadata fields and can choose which ones you'd like to include in your faceting browse.  For the ones you'd like to include, fill in a user-friendly label values, choose the "type" -- either "date" for years or "text" for anything else, and the order you'd like them displayed.  Dates will always be listed before text fields.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1114" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2021/05/FacetConfig-1024x380.png" alt="" width="1024" height="380" /></p>
<p>Once you save the configuration, you can go to your collection, scroll to the bottom right and see the facets you've configured.  Choosing values or date ranges will limit the documents you seen in the main collection view.</p>
