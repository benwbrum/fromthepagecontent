<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>“Like many archives at the university level, we are eager for students to use archival collections in an intellectually rigorous way. Students and alumni find that crowdsourcing transcription is fun and interesting, as well as academically substantive. Having the documents transcribed enables us to ask different questions and to automate larger-scale data exploration of the primary sources. FromThePage is such a feature-rich, easy-to-use platform that using it for archival records about early Chinese students has been a worthwhile, key phase of our larger project. We have been so fortunate to have FromThePage to keep people engaged with the archives remotely during the pandemic. It is a very intuitive platform for archives and volunteers.”</em></p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>“With all of its features, FromThePage has proven to be incredibly useful for us in cultivating community engagement, developing research initiatives, and enhancing collection accessibility. This is primarily due to the customization the platform enables. On the one hand, project contributors have the ability to reconfigure with relative ease their workspace and workflows, such as using dictation to transcribe. On the project management side, the import and export features being designed and deployed as part of the NEH-funded work with UT Libraries will greatly facilitate the movement of collections between our institutional repositories and the platform to expedite access and preserve citizen scholarship.”</em></p>

<p><em>“My experience has been resoundingly positive. Since the very first day we uploaded our documents to the website, we’ve had volunteers from around the globe dive into the project. Additionally, using FromThePage provides a centralized place where I can send volunteers who are interested in transcribing, where I can answer questions quickly and easily, and where I can track progress on the project. Previously, I had been emailing chunks of records to people who were interested in transcribing, which was an extremely inefficient, difficult to track, and overly stressful method. Using FromThePage has streamlined my entire operation and greatly improved the quality and speed of our transcriptions.”</em></p>

From an administrator's perspective, this had to be one of the easiest platforms to start up. It took all of 10-20 minutes to get our account and project started, and our transcriber managed to transcribe 20 pages before the end of the first day! Honestly, the barrier-to-entry is almost non-existent, volunteers significantly improve the accessibility of our holdings, and the rewards can be seen almost immediately.”</em></p>

<p>There are so many options… Facilitate a deep reading of primary sources with simply having students transcribe sources. Have students index people, places, and topics in the transcribed text, then write short articles about the indexed terms. Teach text encoding&nbsp; through marking up text using TEI tags in our advanced editor. Have students transcribe a page and then translate it. Explore texts with our integrations with Voyant or WordTrees, or export text to use other digital humanities tools.</p>

<p><strong>Uncertain if your students can read historic writing styles?</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>With cursive rarely being taught in schools, there may be a learning curve for students not exposed to documents from the 20th century or earlier. Consider providing a tutorial on the basics of the script and writing style of your materials. Also, working together to puzzle through a page of material as a class or pairing students up can be helpful. There is always the option to utilize historical typewritten sources as well.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<figcaption>Sewanee: The University of the South is transcribing names of thousands imprisoned at the Lone Rock Stockade; highlighting the brutality of one place within a state-wide and region-wide practice. So far over 2800 names, 80% belonging to African Americans, have been documented through transcription work using FromThePage. Given the difficulties encountered in conducting genealogical research on African American communities, these documents could serve as a rich resource for modern descendants.

<figcaption>Adam Rabinowitz, a Classics Professor at the University of Texas at Austin, uses FromThePage as a teaching tool in an undergraduate course. Each student is assigned to find the primary source materials in the archive and transcribe a letter in the collection using FromThePage. Then a larger collection of transcribed letters are provided to write a paper.

<figcaption>University of Southern Mississippi is transcribing, and annotating 20,000 digitized documents from the governor’s papers from the Civil War through the Reconstruction era. Transcription of letters to the governor provides a view of people experiencing this contentious time regardless of class, gender, race, religion, nativity, and age; traditional sources cannot provide access to that diversity. The collection includes lesson plans to help secondary educators incorporate these diverse nineteenth-century collections into classrooms.

<figcaption>Princeton's Department of Art and Archaeology used FromThePage to create an open dataset of 25 expedition notebooks of Howard Crosby Butler’s early 1900’s surveys of archaeological sites in Syria. This created access to documentation of the endangered or destroyed archaeological sites. The goal was to open this understudied material to yield meaningful findings, including for those interested in cultural heritage in Syria. To increase access, it is also being translated into Arabic; read more <a href="https://content.fromthepage.com/an-interview-with-julia-gearhart-of-princetons-department-of-art-and-archaeology/">here</a>.</figcaption>

<p>Dr. Julie deGraffenried &amp; Benna Vaughan of Baylor University presented archival documents in a classroom setting to give students research experience in primary sources. Students used FromThePage to transcribe the 1916 minutes of the Evangelia Settlement House, the first daycare program for underprivileged children in Waco, Texas. Students experienced first-hand how transcription is a public service history enthusiasts can perform for the public.

<figcaption>Dr. Laura Morreale, an scholar of medieval francophonie and Italian historiographies uses FromThePage to make unknown or little-known text more accessible to scholars, students, and the general public. This work combines collaboration, transcription, digital humanities, and handwritten medieval manuscripts in non-English languages, often in a difficult or unfamiliar hand. Using FromThePage as a research and a pedagogical tool has made medieval sources easier to read, understand, and disseminate; learn more <a href="https://content.fromthepage.com/interview-dr-laura-morreale-on-teaching-and-collaborative-research-in-fromthepage/">here</a>.&nbsp;</figcaption>

<p><em>“I have used FromThePage as both a research and a pedagogical tool; not having to wrestle with the tool is so helpful in keeping up the momentum of the work. I can confidently ask my colleagues to collaborate without asking them to spend hours learning a new tool or interface. A four year remote collaboration project has endured to a great extent because we could bring project members in seamlessly. In the classroom, my students have found transcribing exciting and gratifying, and a wonderful addition to the secondary material we are learning. Students really like learning this way because it is an unmediated experience; this is a real experience of meeting a scribe through his or her writings.”</em></p>

<p><em>The platform is straightforward; not having to learn a bunch of code or a complicated platform is such a relief.
