<p>We recently added a "Finish" button in addition to a "Save" button.</p>
<p>For projects where everything is set to "needing review" here are the behaviors:</p>
<ul>
<li>a "save" will keep the page in the incomplete/untranscribed state</li>
<li>a "finish" will mark it as "transcribed" but "needs review"</li>
<li>if it's "needs review" then you'll see an "approve" button as well as a "save" button. The "save" will keep it in "needs review" and "approve" will move it to "complete"</li>
</ul>
<p>If a page is "complete" you can still make and "save" changes, and the page will be set back to "needs review"</p>
<h3>For visual thinkers:</h3>

<p>Here's the transcriber experience:</p>
<h3>1st: Transcribing</h3>
<p><img class="CToWUd a6T" tabindex="0" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2021/04/0?ui=2&amp;ik=281c701f60&amp;attid=0.1&amp;permmsgid=msg-f:1698296419821456863&amp;th=17918f988ac68ddf&amp;view=fimg&amp;sz=s0-l75-ft&amp;attbid=ANGjdJ8bWyUFU18h8SF9Ho1bvLG2qSoTEQkAXApg0XvNTaoyABB4IyiS0jGgB1od2WQUKly3kqlthdjaEYAx5QiWvOLNwRfDisUSlFYjzUVg3EWlTrmi0iXl_6gXUvI&amp;disp=emb&amp;realattid=ii_knvs4pkv0" alt="Screen Shot 2021-04-24 at 9.25.26 AM.png" width="551" height="254" data-image-whitelisted="" /></p>
<div>This is what pages will start with. The big difference is the separation of "Save" and "Finish", this means that your can press save multiple times as you work, and even if you can't finish transcribing the whole page, pressing "Save" will preserve your work but still make it show up with "Pages that Need Transcription". Use the "Finish" button when transcribing is done and the page will be sent to the 2nd stage, reviewing and editing.</div>

<h3>2nd: Review and Editing</h3>
<p><img class="CToWUd a6T" tabindex="0" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2021/04/0?ui=2&amp;ik=281c701f60&amp;attid=0.2&amp;permmsgid=msg-f:1698296419821456863&amp;th=17918f988ac68ddf&amp;view=fimg&amp;sz=s0-l75-ft&amp;attbid=ANGjdJ-NnGjddAmAq926uBojjL6VmaIQ8mbytruC-sq9bNoHtFq3L3y9PnnMnfScvRgR5VFEMxSwM1YlduCqx0tcT1AQNZFbVjxuO-8Emmt9oqlPQvaiI98FopA3TEk&amp;disp=emb&amp;realattid=ii_knvsan0f1" alt="Screen Shot 2021-04-24 at 9.18.35 AM.png" width="551" height="294" data-image-whitelisted="" /></p>
<div>This set of buttons show up after "Finish" was pressed. You can see that the "Needs Review" sentence shows up and is more obvious about what tasks a user needs to do. Just like before, pressing save keeps your work in this stage but saves your progress. Clicking "Approve" is the replacement for unchecking the Needs Review Box, and will send the page to the "Complete" stage.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<h3>3rd: Completed</h3>
<p><img class="CToWUd a6T" tabindex="0" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2021/04/0?ui=2&amp;ik=281c701f60&amp;attid=0.3&amp;permmsgid=msg-f:1698296419821456863&amp;th=17918f988ac68ddf&amp;view=fimg&amp;sz=s0-l75-ft&amp;attbid=ANGjdJ_3xQ5iWjLEBFkCyRvOMA2d1wh9gR4FRozo60QVIzRX1rSOOn9mO0VRJWKT2GvcSIbB0rLHl2U5N17bkd62UK-Nm-t-X6Va2shE_PWIB-aliSnH-djAZ6mL7BQ&amp;disp=emb&amp;realattid=ii_knvsg8902" alt="Screen Shot 2021-04-24 at 9.21.57 AM.png" width="551" height="276" data-image-whitelisted="" /></p>
<div>This is what buttons will appear on a page in its "Completed" phase. The good thing is that you can still make any corrections by pressing "Save" if you catch a typo or need to make something that matches our standards. If you make a change and press "Save" it will send it back to the 2nd step "Needs Review" so another user can approve your changes.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>This will become more useful to projects who would like to separate reviewers and transcribers next quarter when we introduce the "reviewer" role for users. If you choose to use that you can designate users as "reviewers" and they and project owners will be the only ones to see the "approve" button and approve pages.</div>
