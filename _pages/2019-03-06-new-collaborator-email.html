<p>You have new collaborators! You should send them a short note welcoming them to your project. The note should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>what the project is</li>
<li>what the transcribed material will be used for</li>
<li>any training materials you have (link to the help tab and the transcription conventions)</li>
<li>how to contact you</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a good welcome note?  We'd love to share it.  Just send it to us at support@fromthepage.com.</p>
