<p><b>Only an owner can add or delete a collection, work or page. </b></p>
<p><b>How do I get started? </b>To start a project, go to the Owner Dashboard and choose the "Start a Project" tab.  You can upload a file with images or import from the Internet Archive, a IIIF repository, or an Omeka site.</p>
<p><b>How do I delete a collection or work? </b> Click on the collection or work you would like to delete, and go to the Settings tab. Scroll down to see a "Delete Collection" or "Delete Work" button on the left side of the page.</p>
<p><b>How do I add a page to a work? </b> From the Owner Dashboard, go to the specific work to which you'd like to add a page. In the Pages tab, click the "Add New Page" button to the right to add a new page to the work. You can use the arrows to the right of the page listings to arrange the pages in the correct order.</p>
<p><b>How do I delete a page from a work? </b> From the Owner Dashboard, go to the specific work where the page resides. In the Pages tab, click the Delete button to the right of the page you would like to delete.</p>
<p><b>How do I create a document set? </b> Only the owner of a collection can create a document set. Within the collection, go into the Settings tab and clicking on the "Create Document Sets" button on the right side of the page.</p>
<p><b>How do I turn on support for translating a work or collection? </b> Translation support is set at the work level. From the Owner Dashboard, choose the work and go to the Settings tab. In the Settings tab, check the "Supports translation" checkbox to turn on support for translation. This will add an additional "Translate" tab to each page of the work.</p>
<p><b>What does the "Pages are meaningful" checkbox mean? </b> In some works, pages are meaningful semantic divisions, such as in a journal with a separate date for each page. In others, the text is more free-flowing, and the individual pages are not separate sections, such as in letters or a book. When "Pages are meaningful" is checked, the page titles are prominently displayed, because they are meaningful divisions.</p>
<p><b>How do I create or delete a category? </b> When you are in the Subjects tab of a collection, you can add a category by clicking on the Actions button on the right side of the screen. Then select a Root/Child category. You can also delete a category in this view.</p>
<p><b>How do I move a work to a different collection?</b>  Click on the work title.  Go to the <b>settings</b> tab for the work.  The 2nd field is which collection the work is part of; use the dropdown to select a different collection.</p>
