<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To add staff members as additional project owners, simply go to the collection settings tab. Type the email address of the staff member you're trying to add, select it from the list, and click "Add". Staff must already have an account on FromThePage.&nbsp;You can do this for as many staff members as you'd like.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Staff members receive the nightly activity email for the project and can do everything a project owner can except delete the project.</p>

<p>To add staff members as transcribers, go to the "Collection Collaborators" section in the collection settings tab, on the right side.&nbsp; Type the email address of the collaborator you're trying to add, select it from the list, and click "Add". Staff must already have an account on FromThePage. You can do this for as many collaborators as you'd like.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Collaborators can see a private collection they belong to in their user dashboard, and can transcribe, edit, and comment on the project.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Staff have the following privileges:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>1)&nbsp; On collections they are added to as staff (each collection individually) they can do everything but delete the collection.&nbsp; This includes adding material, changing settings, and viewing collaborator data.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>2)&nbsp; They can create collections, which will show up under the main JHU account.&nbsp; They become staff (see #1) on those collections.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>3)&nbsp; They can't see or change collections under the JHU account that they have not been added to.</p>
