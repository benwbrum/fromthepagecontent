<p>Owner emails show the contributions to your project in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A typical owner email will contain:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: initial;">Recent transcriptions (including who did them and links to the pages</span>)</li>
<li>Pages that have been marked "Needs Review"</li>
<li>Recent notes that transcribers have added</li>
<li>The list of the most active collaborators and the total time they have contributed to your project</li>
<li>All the email addresses of everyone who has worked on your project</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The owner emails go to the email address of the project owner. If you want someone else in your organization to also get these emails, you will need to add them as a secondary owner on the project.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Owner emails only go out when your project has activity.</p>
