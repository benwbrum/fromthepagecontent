<p><b>What is a collection? </b> A collection is a set of documents (works) that have been collected together to form a unit. Each work must belong to a collection, each page to a work. Collections and works can be translated as well as transcribed. By default a collection is visible to anyone accessing FromThePage from the internet. This can be changed by the owner of a collection.</p>
<p><b>What is a work? </b> A work is an individual item (book, article, journal, letter, etc.) that is uploaded into a collection. A work belongs to a single collection.</p>
<p><b>What is a page? </b> A page is the smallest unit within a work (such as pages in a book, article, journal, etc.) It is a single image from a work, generally a single page within a book or a letter, although occasionally a scan can span multiple pages in one image.</p>
<p><b>What is a project? </b> A project is a collection with at least one uploaded or imported work.</p>
<p><b>What are document sets? </b> Document sets are subsets of works in a collection, which can be used to focus an editing project or to create a public exhibition about a particular focus of the documents. These can be created by the owner of a collection.</p>
<p><b>What are subjects? </b> Subjects are topics within a document which could be grouped within a category. Subjects work similarly to tags. You can create subjects when you are transcribing pages or after you have transcribed them by going into a collection and selecting the subjects tab.</p>
<p><b>What are categories? </b> Categories are groups of related subjects/information. Categories allow you to visualize relationships between subjects (topics) within a collection. For example, you can visualize the frequency of a subjects's occurence in a collection and compare that with the frequencies of other subjects' occurrences within the collection. Categories and subjects only search and link within a single collection. Categories are created by the owner of the collection.</p>
