<h3><strong>What are Incomplete Pages?</strong></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>FromThePage doesnâ€™t count pages as transcribed until they are marked done (review optional configuration) or approved (review required). If you have pages that are transcribed but not marked done, they would be "Incomplete." Pages that are in "Needs Review" are not counted as transcribed or indexed -- they are in an incomplete state. If review is required and you edit a page, it goes back to "needs review" and the page is back to being incomplete.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When pages are uploaded their status is blank/not started. If users hit the save button, the status moves to "Incomplete". Both of these are included in the count of incomplete pages we show on the statistics screen.</p>

<h3><strong>What are Transcribed Pages?</strong></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When a page is marked blank or approved, it enters one of our terminal/completed states and shows up as "Transcribed".</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<h3><strong>What are Pages Needing Review?</strong></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Project owners may enable Required Review on their project. As a result, when a user presses Done, the page status does not move to Completed, but rather into "Needs Review".</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To summarize, Pages, Incomplete Pages, Transcribed Pages, and Pages Needing Review are all calculated from the current status of pages in the project. Pages move from "Incomplete" to "Transcribed" when users press the Done button or the Approve button instead of just pressing the Save button.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The following video explains when to use the Done button and can be shared with transcribers.</p>

<p>Pages have statuses; the percentages are just "pages with that status/total of pages in the work" (work = document; could be a 2-page letter or a 500-page book). They are sorted into three types:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li><strong>transcribed percentage</strong>: A page that has been edited and any text typed into it is "transcribed". (We can't tell that it's "done" based on this, but we infer "transcribed" by the presence of any text on the page. </li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li><strong>corrected percentage</strong>: similar to transcribed, but for projects that import OCR text to be corrected. Pages with imported text aren't corrected until the first edit is made. </li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li><strong>reviewed percentage</strong>: The "reviewed" status that gets set to true when someone either unchecks the "needs review" checkbox (optional review) or "approved" (required review). We show a "% needing review" -- pages with "needs review" set to true / total number of pages.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
