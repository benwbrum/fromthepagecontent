<p><em>“Crowdsourcing is a great fit for state archives. It’s an efficient way of reaching out to people interested in the archives and offering them a specific project to work on. For our first project with FromThePage we transcribed 50,000 marriage certificates, which have no index, and have to be searched by hand otherwise. We don’t have the staff for a data-entry project of this magnitude; we need to utilize volunteers. The fielded-form of FromThePage, along with the desire of the volunteer transcribers to help create something useful for the benefit of many, has made this project successful.”</em></p>

We accomplished a massive indexing project of over 111,000 WWI service records cards more quickly than we ever could have in-house.

<p>We know your community is underserved by technologists. We are changing that.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As experienced software developers we have created a tool that works incredibly well, but more importantly it works well to make transcription of your records efficient and easy.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For every client we start by diving deep on your particular resources with you to talk through optimal transcription strategies and set-up.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>It’s as easy as adding digitized record documents to FromThePage and inviting your community to help transcribe those materials.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We present an image of the uploaded page to a user and a place for them to type what's on the page. Those two things together make magic, but the magic is done by humans.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You’ve scanned your collection for years, but no one can find the text locked in your images. Use FromThePage to free your images and engage collaborators everywhere.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>No need to wonder if our software can measure up to your unique holdings, we are happy to share case studies to highlight a wide variety of use cases.</p>

<p>The Alabama Department of Archives and History staff spent 18 months digitizing 111,000 WWI service record cards and in only 3.5 months volunteer transcribers finished them all. FromThePage made it easy to keep track of all the volunteers, many who were not even in Alabama. People were looking for worthwhile projects, and the geographic boundaries of the documents mattered way less than staff thought they would. When this project was done the virtual volunteers were clamoring for more and the archives went to work getting more digitized collections up on the platform.

<p>The Maryland State Archives had volunteer transcribers help create an index for over 50,000 marriage certificates. Archivists no longer need to search by hand for the record. This was made more difficult if the patron couldn’t remember the date of their marriage but desperately needed the certificate to apply for social security benefits, a passport, or a driver’s license renewal. Digitized, searchable indexes of records make an enormous difference in helping people who need them and those who use them for genealogical purposes.

<p>The State Archives of North Carolina has active collections on varying topics on FromThePage, including Local Draft Board Records, Colonial Court Records, African American Education, World War I Diaries, WWI and WWII Letters, and Women’s History. Their grant-funded project North Carolina’s Early Court Records kicked-off their use of the platform. Beyond their goal to broaden accessibility to the collections, they also wanted to engage public volunteers with the work of the archives through transcription. Now patrons anywhere in the world can perform full-text searches on the transcribed documents; find out more <a href="https://content.fromthepage.com/olivia-carlisle/">here</a>.</figcaption>

<figcaption>The Indiana Archives and Records Administration used FromThePage to create an index of Indiana’s WWI service record cards with the goal of honoring veterans and making history more accessible. Interest in transcribing records made it a very efficient way to index a large collection and illustrate the value of the archives to more people. FromThePage is a valuable platform for helping to make that connection happen.

<p>The Library of Virginia houses 14,900 World War I Questionnaires gathered from 1919-1921 by the Virginia War History Commission. They cover the veteran’s personal information and war record in detail. The Library used FromThePage to capture all the data from the questionnaires, fully transcribing them to honor the 100-year anniversary of WWI. They continued to transcribe other field-based documents, to further increase access and searchability of their records.

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>“Our experience using FromThePage has been very positive. Our goal was to capture all the data from the WWI Questionnaires, as well as other field-based documents, in order to increase access and searchability. We chose an absolute beast of a form to attempt as our first structured data transcription set: 118 lines, some with 3 or 4 fields per line, with a total of over 200 fields. Ben and Sara worked with our team at the Library to upload all the images, make the form properly, and even incorporate new features we needed. Crowdsourcing has been immensely popular with our users, and we want to continue to build on this type of interaction with ongoing projects. We look forward to continuing to work with users and FromThePage to improve our collections and generate new interactions.”</em></p>

<p><em>“We utilize FromThePage to broaden accessibility to our collections and also to engage public volunteers. Our goals are to increase access through expanded arrangement, description, and digitization, providing greater keyword searching and increased accessibility when cursive or archaic spelling may present a barrier to reading archival materials. Now on transcribed materials we can perform full text searches! Also, the platform is very simple and straightforward to use. One of the best features is its compatibility with CONTENTdm, the digital management software we utilize. Exporting the completed transcriptions is a two-step process requiring very little effort.”</em></p>

<p><em>“Records are absolutely a frontline necessity for so many aspects of our lives–authorization for medical care, government and employee benefits, passports, even final burial. If you can't find the record you're sunk. I got a call from a woman who needed her marriage certificate so she could authorize treatment for her husband who was hospitalized with covid. I used an index created by FromThePage volunteer transcribers to find the certificate, and was able to email a copy to her in less than thirty minutes. It was a wonderful feeling to be able to help her in a dire time.”</em></p>
