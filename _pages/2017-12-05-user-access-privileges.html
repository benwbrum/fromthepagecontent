<p><b>Can an owner restrict access to collections or works? </b> Yes, access can be restricted at the collection or work level, though not at the level of a specific page.</p>
<p><b>How do I manage access to my collections? </b> After you sign in, go to the Owner Dashboard by clicking the Dashboard button. Select the collection you want to restrict. In the Settings tab, click the "Make Collection Private" button to restrict visibility to the owners of the collection. Additional owners can be added in the dropdown box below.</p>
<p><b>How do I manage access to my works? </b> After you sign in, go to the Owner Dashboard by clicking the Dashboard button. Click the link for the work you would like to restrict. In the Settings tab for the work, select the "Restrict collaborators" checkbox and then hit apply. Once collaborators are restricted, a dropdown box appears where collaborators can be added.</p>
<p><b>Who can transcribe a work? </b> Anyone with a FromThePage account can transcribe any work, unless "restrict collaborators" is checked by the owner in the Work Settings tab. To restrict transcription to certain users, select the <strong>settings</strong> tab for the work, check the "Restrict Editors" box on the right hand side and hit save. The page will refresh with a list of all registered users on the right hand side under the "Allowed Editors" heading. Select the name of any users you want to permit to transcribe this work.</p>
