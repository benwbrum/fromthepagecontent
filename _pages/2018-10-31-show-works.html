<p>We automatically hide all the works that are completed, so transcribers don't get confused or disheartened.Â  You can get them back when you click "show all" at the bottom of the work list for the collection:</p>
<div><a href="http://content.fromthepage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ShowAll.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-786 size-medium" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2018/10/ShowAll-300x131.png" alt="" width="300" height="131" /></a></div>
