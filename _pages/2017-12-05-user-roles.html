<p><b>What is an owner? </b> An owner is the user to whom a collection or work, and all the associated pages and sets, belongs. An owner has full control over a collection, works and pages associated with them. Owners also control the privileges assigned to a work or page.</p>
<p><b>Can a collection have multiple owners? </b>The owner can add staff members as additional owners on a collection.  These staff-owners can add material, edit the settings, and will receive the overnight activity email on the collection.  They can't delete the collection. The original owner (who created the collection) cannot be deleted.</p>
<p><b>What is a collaborator? </b> Collaborators transcribe or translate pages in a work/collection. They can also edit page titles if the work owner has given them permission to do so.</p>
<p><b>Who can transcribe a work? </b> Anyone with a FromThePage account can transcribe any work, unless collaborators have been restricted by the owner of the work.</p>
