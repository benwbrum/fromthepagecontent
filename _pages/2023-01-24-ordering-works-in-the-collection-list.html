<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>By default, we list works in alphabetical order. If you would like to order of works in the collection list, you can use numbers proceeding their titles to force a different order ("1 work title", "2 work title", "3 german work title").</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Another way to change the order is to  add one of the following special characters to the beginning of the work title to get it dropped to the end of the list:  “{“, “|”, “}”, and “~”. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
