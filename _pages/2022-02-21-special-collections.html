Adhering to this mission requires a further commitment to digital accessibility and the inclusive practice of removing barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to, digital content by people with disabilities. By providing accurate transcriptions, translations, and correcting OCR, we expand access to this content for all online users in accordance with WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility guidelines.

<p><em>“We wanted to enrich our digitized collections, improving both the searchability and the accessibility of our records; a notoriously difficult thing for most archives to do, but here we have a way forward to address accessibility issues, and have full text available for screen readers. From an administrator's perspective, this had to be one of the easiest platforms to start up. It took all of 10-20 minutes to get our account and project started, and our transcriber managed to transcribe 20 pages before the end of the first day! Honestly, the barrier-to-entry is almost non-existent, and the rewards can be seen almost immediately. The dashboard and summary give us some great stats, and let us know who our most active volunteers are. Now, we can leverage the power of a whole world of volunteers to spend a few minutes here and there in a week to significantly improve the accessibility of our holdings.”</em></p>

Students and alumni find that crowdsourcing transcription is fun and interesting, as well as academically substantive. Having the documents transcribed enables us to ask different questions and to automate larger-scale data exploration of the primary sources. FromThePage is such a feature-rich, easy-to-use platform that using it for archival records about early Chinese students has been a worthwhile, key phase of our larger project. We have been so fortunate to have FromThePage to keep people engaged with the archives remotely during the pandemic. It is a very intuitive platform for archives and volunteers.”</em></p>

<p>The Iowa State University Library has loaded 43 collections totaling more than 42,000 pages into FromThePage with the goal of providing accurate transcriptions to expand access to content for all online users. A variety of Special Collections &amp; University Archives materials are worked on by crowdsourced collaborators. Six collections have been made available to the public with more released as they are fully transcribed. Check out how easy the upload process has been for them <a href="https://content.fromthepage.com/daniel-hartwig-hannah-scates-kettler/">here</a>.</figcaption>

<p><a href="https://fromthepage.com/ohiouniversitylibraries">Ohio University Libraries </a>uses FromThePage to generate transcriptions and descriptive metadata for dance posters in their collection. This project is a hybrid project, transcriptions are generated along with text from the posters captured through standardized metadata fields. This allows more accessibility and findability by users, also allowing discovery of related posters based on the standardized fields.

<p>Adam Rabinowitz, a Classics Professor at the University of Texas at Austin, uses FromThePage as a teaching tool in an undergraduate course. Each student is assigned to find the primary source materials in the archive and transcribe any letter in the collection using FromThePage. Then a larger collection of transcribed letters are provided to write a paper.

<p>Heather Home and Jeremy Heil of Queen's University Archives use FromThePage to make primary source material more accessible, searchable, and usable. Transcription helps foster research, reveal information, and highlight materials that are often thought to be “hidden” due to the fact that their contents are not easily searchable how people have become accustomed.

<p>Paige Roberts, Director of Archives and Special Collections at Phillips Academy oversees several of the archive’s collections on FromThePage. Students are transcribing some of the documents for a course on the early Chinese student population at the academy. Students and also alumni find that crowdsourcing transcription is academically substantive and FromThePage has made it easy to keep people engaged with the archives remotely during the pandemic. The transcriptions will be used in the creation of a robust web site to share the documents, transcriptions, historical context, and lesson plans for teachers; read more <a href="https://content.fromthepage.com/paige-roberts/">here</a>.</figcaption>

<p><em>“FromThePage has proven to be a very versatile tool. It’s a great platform for collaborative work, making it easy for all users to simultaneously edit, review, and track progress within a collection. The management features also allow a lot of flexibility. Using the field-based transcription option, for example, we’ve created projects to tag works and collect metadata so our collaborators can assist with content description, in addition to transcribing. The software lends itself to creative uses by allowing administrators to configure projects and access the data in a variety of ways.”</em></p>

<p><em>“The killer feature that takes FromThePage well beyond other transcription interfaces I have seen [...] is the powerful yet simple wiki-like annotation and indexing feature. Using simple double brackets, or an optional automatic suggested markup feature, simple transcriptions immediately become “tagged” (though only for items explicit in a text, rather than arbitrary tags) in a truly powerful way, allowing visitors to find documents through a index of subjects, places, or people – or jump immediately from linked subjects within a text to others like it in what becomes a rich hypertext environment.”</em></p>

<p><em>“With all of its features, FromThePage has proven to be incredibly useful for us in cultivating community engagement, developing research initiatives, and enhancing collection accessibility. This is primarily due to the customization the platform enables. On the one hand, project contributors have the ability to reconfigure with relative ease their workspace and workflows, such as using dictation to transcribe. On the project management side, the import and export features being designed and deployed as part of the NEH-funded work with UT Libraries will greatly facilitate the movement of collections between our institutional repositories and the platform to expedite access and preserve citizen scholarship.”</em></p>
