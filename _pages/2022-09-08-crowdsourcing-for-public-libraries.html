<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>“Most of our volunteers were unfamiliar with the library’s digital collections before learning about the opportunity to volunteer with us, so there is value beyond just the transcripts they produce. FromThePage works for libraries at different levels; institutions like Stanford who are integrating IIIF are impressive, but it is beyond the scope of our project. I love that the site works for a public library as well as an academic one and we benefit from working alongside different institutions on a digital platform, in part because of the shared volunteer traffic. We've introduced dozens of people to transcription who previously had no experience with it whatsoever. We can expand the library’s volunteer base while also promoting the collections and seeing transcribers' joy at puzzling out a difficult word or finding something funny in an old letter has been a real blast!”</em></p>

<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>“Having transcriptions for some of our most significant manuscript collections has been extremely valuable for researchers and Library staff, allowing the interrogation of large archival collections in an efficient way. Crowdsourcing has allowed us to harness the enthusiasm of digital volunteers, and the outcomes of these projects have proved to be mutually beneficial to both parties in achieving objectives of deeper public engagement with the collections and for the Library to build ongoing relationships with volunteers and establish a greater understanding of their interests, habits, and motivations for supporting the Library.”</em></p>

<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>“Most people are unaware of the lengthy process required to make digital images of textual documents discoverable. This issue is compounded by handwritten and typed documents. Documents created on typewriters in the late 19th and early 20th centuries have irregular margins, lines, and typed-over script. These characteristics make optical text recognition (OCR) nearly impossible, and the results are unreliable. Crowdsourced transcription easily solves this problem. FromThePage has reduced the amount of time spent preparing documents for publishing in our digital archives. Using crowdsourced transcription to speed up the process of indexing and publishing keyword searchable records to digital archives helps institutions make their collections discoverable from anywhere. My experience with FromThePage has by far exceeded my expectations.”&nbsp;</em></p>

Our goal was to capture all the data from the WWI Questionnaires, as well as other field-based documents, in order to increase access and searchability. We chose an absolute beast of a form to attempt as our first structured data transcription set: 118 lines, some with 3 or 4 fields per line, with a total of over 200 fields. Ben and Sara worked with our team at the Library to upload all the images, make the form properly, and even incorporate new features we needed. Crowdsourcing has been immensely popular with our users, and we want to continue to build on this type of interaction with ongoing projects. We look forward to continuing to work with users and FromThePage to improve our collections and generate new interactions.”</em></p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Apprehensive about the time required to manage projects?</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You can upload documents in small amounts over time, the work is all defined by your project timeline. Also, training staff or expert volunteers to be in a reviewer role means your time doesn’t need to be monopolized by review of transcriptions. And keeping tabs on work is easy, our nightly activity reports show you progress in your inbox every morning.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The extensive list of projects we’ve consulted on allows us to make suggestions to make sure your projects will be successful and will not take excess time and effort on your part.</p>

<p>After our custom demo call, if it doesn’t seem like a good fit, we can recommend different approaches, other collaborators, or other platforms if they’re more appropriate — we really don’t want you to use our software if it’s wrong for your needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We do want you to be successful. We will support you however we can in charting your path to reach your library's goals.</p>

<p><strong>Worried FromThePage won’t work for your specific project?</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We can share examples of other projects that are doing similar work. This allows us to strategize with you on how best to tackle your particular materials and gives you an idea of the vast variety of projects we’ve supported.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Concerned you won’t have time to learn yet another piece of software?</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It is our mission to make it easier, more enjoyable, and more productive to expand your online offerings. We will help you set up your interface so you are ready to hit the ground running, with your team or with volunteers. We can help you with recruitment strategies and also promote the project through the FromThePage website to our established, enthusiastic transcriber community.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The flexibility of the platform coupled with the import/export options and the support of many different document types means integration is really simple.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<figcaption>FromThePage allows the public to have meaningful interaction with the Genealogy, Local History &amp; Archives Unit of the Fort Worth Public Library. Over 8,000 pages have been transcribed in a little over a year. Volunteers enjoy making a contribution to the historical record by transcribing hand-written or type-written documents, helping make digitized records more useful to researchers by speeding up the indexing process.

<figcaption>Indianapolis Public Library has six collections on FromThePage comprising a diverse range of document types. Their goal is to provide comprehensive full-text searchability because some collections are almost unusable without the ability to search the documents. Transcription will make a host of genealogical information accessible where previously it was nearly impossible to find a specific name or other information. Read more on how volunteers are helping increase the visibility of the collections to Indianapolis residents and beyond <a href="https://content.fromthepage.com/indianapolis-public-library/">here</a>.</figcaption>

<figcaption>Los Angeles County Library’s Office of Indian Affairs has 5,300 handwritten letters about interactions with California Indians from federal and state government officials and private citizens sent to the federal Office of Indian Affairs between 1849 and 1880. Using FromThePage to create full-text transcripts of the letters opens them up to students, researchers, and others who want to learn about people from that time.

<figcaption>The Alabama Department of Archives and History has transcribed 61 volumes of voter registration oaths taken by white and black men in Alabama in 1875. Each entry records the voter's name, race, and occupation–details invaluable to genealogists and scholars. These are among the state's earliest government records documenting the names of formerly enslaved African American men.

<figcaption>The Library of Virginia houses over 124 million archival items, including 14,900 World War I Questionnaires gathered from 1919-1921. They cover the veteran’s personal information and war record in detail. The Library used FromThePage to fully transcribe all the questionnaire data to honor the 100-year anniversary of WWI. They continue to transcribe other field-based documents, further increasing access and searchability of their records.

<figcaption>East Hampton Public Library is using FromThePage for historical church records to help identify formerly enslaved people and for 63 volumes of whaling logs covering 70 voyages. Cursive handwriting of records has been a barrier for genealogical research and for people to understand some amazing stories, like the first American voyage to Antarctica by Captain Mercator Cooper. Transcripts of materials make them more searchable and accessible, helping people discover historical records without requiring special knowledge on how to decipher difficult handwriting.

<figcaption>The Seattle Municipal Archives has been transcribing records documenting City of Seattle activities from the 1870s to the early 1900s; including letters and petitions to claims, reports, bids, and contracts illustrating the growth of a booming city in the words of everyday people who may not be documented elsewhere. These transcripts are full of gold nuggets for genealogists, and valuable primary sources for students and anyone interested in early Seattle history.

<p><em>“One of our goals is to increase the visibility of our materials and engage new audiences and volunteers in a way that is as “hands-on” as possible in a virtual environment. We like that FromThePage is a web-based platform that can be easily accessed from anywhere and is an uncomplicated platform, easy to set up and also easy for people of any technical ability to use. FromThePage is scalable with different options depending on your number of records and/or institutional capacity, so we’re able to work within a level that best fits our needs. It’s been exciting to hear from our community of volunteer transcribers who say they enjoy this unique way of learning about the history of their city!”</em></p>

<p><em>“Even as computer-generated character recognition continues to improve, the best mechanism for transcription is still the human eye. Historical institutions such as Kentucky Historical Society rely on the hard work of volunteers and staff to create readable and searchable versions of their collections, especially handwritten documents. In many cases, the usefulness of historical resources increases exponentially after transcription. FromThePage provides a platform on which this work can take place quickly and easily. FromThePage is also remarkably easy to use, both from the back end and as a transcriber, and the projects themselves provide an opportunity for users to interact with primary sources virtually even if they can’t visit the institution in person.”</em></p>

The archives used it to create a meaningful World War I centennial commemorative program involving the public. We accomplished a massive indexing project of over 111,000 WWI service records cards more quickly than we ever could have in-house. Working with Ben and Sara we produced the field function feature needed for this project and now it can be adapted for other crowdsourcing projects.
