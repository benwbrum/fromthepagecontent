<p><em>“My experience has been resoundingly positive. Since the very first day we uploaded our documents to the website, we’ve had volunteers from around the globe dive into the project. Additionally, using FromThePage provides a centralized place where I can send volunteers who are interested in transcribing, where I can answer questions quickly and easily, and where I can track progress on the project. Previously, I had been emailing chunks of records to people who were interested in transcribing, which was an extremely inefficient, difficult to track, and overly stressful method. Using FromThePage has streamlined my entire operation and greatly improved the quality and speed of our transcriptions.”</em></p>

<figcaption>Modern scholars may need unpublished research from earlier scholars, such as linguistic surveys of speakers of the Mesoamerican language Mixtec. By transcribing the responses, linguists like Ryan Sullivant (Language Data Curator, Archive of Indigenous Languages of Latin America, University of Texas at Austin) can analyze the Mixtec language spoken 40 years ago. The results are encoded as datasets, and preserved in the AILLA repository.

<p><em>“Howitt and Fison were two of the first anthropologists that studied the Aboriginal people of southern and eastern Australia. Their methodical work on Aboriginal language, kinship, song and culture was pioneering at the time and the information they amassed is now a treasure trove of Australian Aboriginal history. FromThePage is making the transcription work much easier to do and we’re able to collaborate with historians, linguists, anthropologists and Aboriginal people in making these transcripts. We’re also hoping that Aboriginal communities in Australia who are interested in language revitalization will use these resources. FromThePage is so useful for us, as having good quality transcripts that can be verified and worked on by multiple people (including expert linguists and interested Aboriginal people) means that we can more easily share and discuss this work with more and more people.”</em></p>

On the one hand, project contributors have the ability to reconfigure with relative ease their workspace and workflows, such as using dictation to transcribe. On the project management side, the import and export features being designed and deployed as part of the NEH-funded work with UT Libraries will greatly facilitate the movement of collections between our institutional repositories and the platform to expedite access and preserve citizen scholarship.”</em></p>

<p>We developed this software to solve the problems associated with clunky processes of transcription, translation, and transliteration. It is our goal to deliver the best possible solution to make research more rich and accurate, more enjoyable, more collaborative, and absolutely more efficient.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We want to help, so if we don’t currently have the functionality you need, we will develop the solution collaboratively with you, or we will suggest alternate collaborators or platforms to help you reach your research goals.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>That’s what you get when you have developers that are fully invested in your success, teammates that chart you a path, even if it’s not to our own software.</p>
