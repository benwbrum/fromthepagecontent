<div>It is possible to import existing transcripts in the zip file upload.</div>
<div></div>
<div>First, create a folder with image files in it.  Then make sure that each image file has a .txt or .xml file containing the transcript of that page, following the same name conventions as the image, like in this example:</div>
<div><span style="font-family: monospace;">envelope.jpg</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: monospace;">envelope.txt</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: monospace;">page_001.jpg</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: monospace;">page_001.txt</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: monospace;">page_002.jpg</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: monospace;">page_003.txt</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: monospace;">postmark.JPG</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: monospace;">postmark.txt</span></div>
<div></div>
<div>Not all image files need corresponding text files, but the filenames do need to be identical (except for the extension) when there are text files with transcripts.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Create a metadata.yml file if you wish, and place it in the same folder.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Then zip up the folder (along with other folders, if you want), and upload it to the Start a Project screen.  Make sure to check the "import text" box.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The folders should be converted into a FromThePage work with the contents of the text or xml files set as the raw OCR text.  You'll probably want to convert the work into a manuscript transcription work from an OCR correction project (using the checkbox on the collection settings page) so that the nomenclature is changed appropriately.</div>
