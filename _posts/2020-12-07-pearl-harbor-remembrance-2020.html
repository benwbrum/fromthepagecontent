<p>Today marks the 79th year since Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p>On this December day in 1941, 2,403 American citizens were lost in the surprise attack by the Japanese. The following day, America declared war on Japan and thus entered the country into World War II.</p>
<p>Americans, and those all over the world, were forever changed by this global conflict. To get a glimpse into the lives of those closest to the war, here are two World War II collections that include the personal letters of soldiers and military personnel during this time.</p>
