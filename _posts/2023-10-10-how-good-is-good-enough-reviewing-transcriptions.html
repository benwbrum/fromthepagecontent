<p>How good is good enough for your transcription project? We all have a tendency to want things to be “perfect”. Some of us even have a legal obligation for things to be “good”. But humans aren’t perfect. <a href="https://content.fromthepage.com/whats-the-difference-between-a-crowdsourcing-volunteer-and-a-medieval-scribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">We’ve talked about the errors medieval scribes made transcribing – and they were professionals!</a> Humans today also make mistakes. So, how much effort do you put into finding and fixing those mistakes?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When we talk to folks about quality and reviewing documents, we tell two stories that demonstrate the opposite ends of the spectrum.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Maryland State Archives had a long-running project indexing marriage records – vital records of living people – in order to make them findable. This project needed to be *right* because folks need the records for things like authorizing hospital care. (And in fact, Liz, the archivist running the project, <a href="https://content.fromthepage.com/marriage-certificate-transcription/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sent out a note to her transcribers</a> explaining how their work let her find a marriage certificate quickly and enabled someone to get COVID care for a spouse.) So MSA had staff members review every single certificate. Multiple people were dedicating hours of their week to make sure the work was correct.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Library of Virginia, on the other hand, has a collection of colonial court records. Their goal in transcribing these very difficult documents is to make them more findable and discoverable. They pull anything that’s available – complete or incomplete pages or documents, without review – into their DAMs. The attitude is “anything is better than nothing”.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Your needs probably fall somewhere in between. FromThePage offers multiple review configurations: “review optional” (transcribers check a box if they would like a page reviewed); “review required” (all pages are marked as needing review, but anyone can review); and “restricted review” (all pages are marked as needing review but only staff or designated volunteer reviewers can review).</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As you make these choices for your projects, realize everything is a trade-off. Here are some things to consider:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>If you were paying an offshore company to transcribe your documents, what level of quality would you receive? I’m guessing it wouldn’t be perfect, but would be “good enough”.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Transcribers love their work, and take it very seriously. It’s not a job, it’s a passion and because many of them are genealogists, they understand how important accurate transcriptions are to folks researching in your archives.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Reviewing is not nearly as much fun as transcribing. Volunteers may not choose to do it.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>You can “promote” super volunteers to reviewers, leveraging a feeling of significance and honor to ask some of your volunteers to do less fun work.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>We’ve also seen heritage organizations – like the DAR – act as reviewers. In the case I’m thinking of, volunteers were competing for volunteer hours and ran out of material to transcribe on a regular basis! Reviewing, though, was still needed.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>You may end up doing most of the reviews with your labor, or your co-workers.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>You can decide it’s “good enough” at any point and quit, even with pages left to review.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Do you have a way for “downstream” researchers to report problems? This is a great way to acknowledge that work isn’t 100% perfect, and encourage the public to help you QA documents as they are being used.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Once you’ve decided how to approach quality, FromThePage has a review dashboard that focuses on review efforts. We want this to be as painless as possible! The next few newsletters will dive into different tools &amp; approaches to help with review.</p>
