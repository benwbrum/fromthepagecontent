<p>Sue Perdue is is a past president of the <a href="https://www.documentaryediting.org/wordpress/">Association of Documentary Editing</a>, the co-editor of <a href="http://gde.upress.virginia.edu/"><em>A Guide to Documentary Editing</em></a>, and has worked on the Papers of Thomas Jefferson, the Papers of John Marshall, and the Papers of James Madison.</p>
<p><i>First, tell us about your documents.</i></p>
<p>The <a href="https://fromthepage.com/shperdueva/margaret-bayard-smith-digital-edition">Margaret Bayard Smith Transcription Project</a> is part of a larger documentary editing project that I have been working on since 2000. Yes, that's right<span class="Y0NH2b CLPzrc">—</span>18 years at it. The aim of the project is to transcribe and edit the correspondence of Margaret Bayard Smith, the manuscripts of which are at the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/collections/margaret-bayard-smith-papers/about-this-collection/">Library of Congress</a>. They were digitized from microfilm just last year. Smith (1778-1844) was a prolific letter writer as well as writer of essays, novels, and commonplace books. She lived in Washington City at a fascinating time, and she writes extensively about her acquaintances including Thomas Jefferson, James and Dolley Madison, Anna Maria and William&nbsp;Thornton, among others. These people were central to the formation of Washington as the new political capitol in the early 19th century.</p>
<p>There are about 3,000 documents in the collection, and most of them have never been transcribed. That said, I have enlisted interns, friends, and my family members to do transcription in this material.&nbsp;There is a published edition of about 150 of these letters but it is only the tip of the iceberg. I hope to get funding to add the annotation for these documents down the road, but for now, I'm thrilled to have a platform like FromThePage to solicit contributions from folks interested in the Early Republic.</p>
<p><i>What are your goals for the project?</i></p>
<p>I am hoping to get baseline transcriptions of the entire collection. I wouldn't consider these transcriptions authoritative, but the platform helps me move all of this material to greater accessibility and intellectual control.</p>

<p><i>How are you recruiting or finding volunteers/collaborators?</i></p>
<p>It just so happens that a friend of mine, Elizabeth Dowling Taylor, is writing a biography of Smith. She and I are working together to get this material more widely known and it was through her contacts at Monticello where she used to work, that brought in a large group of potential volunteers. I also sent out a notice to some of my acquaintances who are retired documentary editors. I have only used social media in a tiny way to get the word out. I hope to get more material on the site before I make a bigger push to let folks know about the project.</p>
<p><i>Can you share your experience using FromThePage?</i></p>
<p>I have limited experience using crowd-sourcing transcription tools, but I have years of experience transcribing. This has traditionally be done using a copy stand alongside a computer which presents challenges in trying to keep one's place. I have found FromThePage exceptionally good at facilitating transcription. The interface is flexible. The images are easy to manipulate, the transcription pane is very easy to use. I love that I can export TEI XML from the platform. I especially love the ability to mark up names and places. It is extremely easy to deploy<span class="Y0NH2b CLPzrc">—</span>I got my project up and running in about an hour.</p>
<p><i>How does FromThePage and crowd-sourcing fit with more traditional documentary editing?</i></p>
<p>This is a changing landscape. Traditional documentary editing projects have shuddered at the notion of crowd-sourcing transcription. It is not just the perceived threat to job security, but a sense that the process challenges the editorial expertise. I think that is overblown. There is so much material out there that needs transcription and many projects with limited budgets can benefit from this approach.&nbsp; Many projects tend to rely on graduate students to do this kind of work, but I have found they are inconsistent and not entirely reliable for getting large amounts of material transcribed. I am hoping that a small group of devoted transcribers will make this happen. As I see it, crowd-sourcing can serve as the first pass of a project. It creates raw-ish content for the documentary editors and it creates a user community.</p>

<p><i>Anything else you'd like to tell us?</i></p>
<p>I also like the fact that my project shares space with other projects. I think this makes for a nice community of historical materials.</p>
<p>I am planning on sponsoring a transcribing hack-a-thon to generate some interest and community of folks. I would be interested to know if other projects have done this.</p>
