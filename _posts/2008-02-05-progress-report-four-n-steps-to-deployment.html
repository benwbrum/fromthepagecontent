<p>I've completed one of the four steps I outlined below: my Rails app is now living in a SubVersion repository hosted somewhere further than 4 feet from where I'm typing this.</p>
<p><i>However</i>, I've had to add a few more steps to the deployment process.  These included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attempting to install Trac</li>
<li>Installing MySql on DreamHost</li>
<li>Installing SubVersion on DreamHost</li>
<li>Successfully <a href="http://bugzilla.fromthepage.com/">installing</a> BugZilla on DreamHost</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these were included in my <a href="http://manuscripttranscription.blogspot.com/2008/01/four-steps-to-deployment.html">original estimate</a>.</p>
