<p>I've finally picked a name. Despite its attractiveness, "Renan" proved unpronounceable. No wonder my ancestors said "REE-nan": it's at least four phonemes away from a native English word, and nobody who was shown the software was able to pronounce its title.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>FromThePage</i> is the new name. It not as lovely as some of the ones that came out of a brainstorming session (like "HandWritten"), but at least there are no existing software products that use it. I went ahead and registered <code>fromthepage.com</code> and <code>fromthepage.org</code> under the assumption that I'd be able to pull off the WordPress model of open-source software that's also hosted for a fee.</p>
