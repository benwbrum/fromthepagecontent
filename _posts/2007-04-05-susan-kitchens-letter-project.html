<p>Susan Kitchens at<a href="http://familyoralhistory.us/news"> Family Oral History Using Digital Tools</a> <span style="font-style: italic;">[and I thought "Collaborative Manuscript Transcription" was a mouthful!] </span>has a need that's very similar to my own.  She's got a bunch of old letters and she wants to "scan them all and somehow make sense of them digitally".  <a href="http://familyoralhistory.us/news/view/keep_track_of_a_bunch_of_old_letters/">Her post on the subject</a> outlines a plan to embed <span>metadata</span> into the scanned images themselves.  This would allow her to use image viewing software -- she's looking at <a href="http://www.memoryminer.com/"><span>MemoryMiner</span></a> -- to navigate the letter images.</p>
<p>Her project differs from mine in that</p>
<ol>
<li>She's not trying to distribute compact <span>hardcopy</span> versions, a core end-product of FromThePage.</li>
<li>She needs more structured, analytical <span>metadata</span> than a <span>freeform</span> wiki-style "what links here" index can provide.</li>
<li>She doesn't have the collaborative proofreading/correction/annotation needs I've seen in transcribing my great-great grandmother's diaries.</li>
</ol>
<p>Kitchens' needs suggest enhancements to my design in structuring articles.  I'd thought about differentiating general articles on subjects like "cutting match" or "tobacco" from those on people, but maybe further categorization would be worth investigating during early testing.</p>
