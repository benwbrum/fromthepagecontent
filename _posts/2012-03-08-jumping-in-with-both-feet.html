<p>Although I didn't know it at the time, since I began work on FromThePage in 2005 I've had one toe in the digital humanities community.&nbsp; I've worked on <a href="http://fromthepage.com/">FromThePage</a> and I've blogged about crowdsourced manuscript transcription.&nbsp; I've met some smart, friendly people doing fascinating things and I've even taught some of them the magic of regular expressions.&nbsp; But I've always tried to squeeze this work into my "spare time" -- the interstices in the daily life of an involved father and a professional software engineer working a demanding but rewarding job.&nbsp; As the demands of vocation and avocation increase; as disparate duties begin to compete with each other; as new babies come into my home while new technologies come into my workplace and new requests for FromThePage arrive in my inbox, the <a href="http://manuscripttranscription.blogspot.com/2007/06/money-current-situation.html">basement inventor model</a> becomes increasingly untenable.&nbsp; The numbers don't lie: I've only checked in code on <a href="https://github.com/benwbrum/fromthepage/commits/master">four days</a> during the last six months.</p>
<p>In January&nbsp; I was offered an incredible opportunity.&nbsp; Chris Lintott invited me to the Adler Planetarium to meet the Citizen Science Alliance's dev team.&nbsp; This talented, generous team of astronomer-developers gave me a behind-the-scenes tour of their <a href="http://github.com/zooniverse/scribe">Scribe</a> tool--early versions of which powered <a href="http://oldweather.or/">OldWeather.or</a>g--and I was blown away.&nbsp; I don't think I've ever been so excited about a technology, and my mind raced with ideas for projects using it.&nbsp; .&nbsp; Serendipitously, two days later I received email from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Laurie">Ben Laurie</a> asking if I'd like to implement Scribe for the <a href="http://www.freereg.org.uk/">FreeREG</a> project, a part of the FreeBMD genealogy charity that is transcribing parish registers recording the baptisms, marriages, and burials in England and Wales from 1538-1835.&nbsp; All development would be released open source, and all data would be as open as possible.&nbsp; It's a dream project for someone with my interests; there was no way I could pass this up.</p>
<p>So as of March 18 I'm starting a new career as an independent digital history developer.&nbsp; It is heartbreaking to leave my friends at <a href="http://www.convio.com/">Convio</a> after nearly a dozen years, but I'm delighted with the possibilities my new autonomy offers. I hope to specialize in projects relating to crowdsourcing and/or manuscript transcription, but to be honest I'm not sure where this path will lead.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course I plan to devote more time to FromThePage -- this year should finally see the publish-on-demand integration I've always been wishing for, as well as a few other features people have requested.&nbsp; If you've got a project that seems appropriate--whether it involves genealogy or herpetology, agricultural history or textile history--drop me a line.</p>
