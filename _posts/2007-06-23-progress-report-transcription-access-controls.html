<p>I've just checked in transcription authorization, completing the security tasks a work owner may perform.  I decided that owners should be able to mark work as unrestricted -- any logged-in user may transcribe that work.  Otherwise, owners specify which users may transcribe or modify transcriptions.</p>
<p>These administrative features have been some of the quickest to implement, even if they're some of the least exciting.  My next task will involve a lot of research into XML parsers for Ruby and how to use them.  That — coupled with a restricted amount of time to devote to coding — means I probably won't have much progress to report for the next couple of months.  I'll keep blogging, but my posts may take a more speculative turn.</p>
