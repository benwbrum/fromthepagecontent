<p>Alice <span>Armintor</span> Walker responded offline to m<a href="http://manuscripttranscription.blogspot.com/2007/06/feature-sensitive-tags.html">y post on <code>sensitive</code> tags</a>, asking:</p>
<blockquote><p>Do you think you might want to allow sensitive text <span>access</span> to some viewers, but not unregistered users? An archivist might feel better about limiting access to a specific group of people.</p></blockquote>
<p>That's an interesting point, and thanks for the question!</p>
<p>My thought on that had been something like this: There are people the <a href="http://manuscripttranscription.blogspot.com/2007/06/feaure-user-roles.html">owner</a> trusts with sensitive info, and people they don't.  That first group are the scribes, who by definition can see everything.  The second group is everybody else.</p>
<p>But is that too <span>simple</span>?  Are there people the owners trust to view sensitive info, but not to transcribe the text?  The answer may be yes.  I just don't know enough about archival practice.  In the real-world model, <span>FromThePage</span>-style transcription doesn't exist.  So it's quite reasonable that transcribing would be a separate task, requiring more trust than allowing access to view sensitive material.</p>
<p>It'd be easy enough to allow the owner to grant permission to some viewers â€” just an extra tab in the work <span>config</span> screen, with a <span>UI</span> almost identical to the scribe-access list.</p>
