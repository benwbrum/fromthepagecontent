<p>I've just finished coding review requests, the last feature slated for release 1.0.</p>
<p>I figure I've completed 90% of the work to get to 1.0, so I'll dub this check-in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Version 0.5</span>.</p>
<p>The next step is to deploy to a production machine for alpha testing, which I expect will involve at least a few more code changes. But from here on out, every modification is a bug fix.</p>
<p>I'll try to post a bit more on my feature triage, my experience mis-applying the Evil Twin plugin design pattern, and my plans for the future.</p>
