<p><em>Years after starting FromThePage, we realized it is fundamentally a documentary editing platform. As we've gone about educating ourselves on documentary editing -- and improving FromThePage with what we learned -- we've found some resources we think might be interesting to anyone running a transcription project, whatever their discipline.<br />

<blockquote><p><strong>Note 5.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Interest in editing scientific manuscripts is increasing also, as evidenced by a Conference on Science Manuscripts in Washington on 5-6 May 1960; one of the papers presented was Whitfield J. Bell, Jr., "Editing a Scientist's Papers," Isis, 53 (1962), 14-19, which takes Benjamin Franklin as its principal example.<strong><br />
