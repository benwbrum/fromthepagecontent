<p><a href="http://www.brumfieldlabs.com">Brumfield Labs</a> and Henry Lovejoy are pleased to announce the launch of the new version of <a href="http://www.slaveryimages.org">SlaveryImages.org</a>. The site contains over 1200 images documenting the experiences of Africans who were enslaved and transported to the Americas and the lives of their descendants in the slave societies of the New World. The images it contains are used by teachers, researchers, students, and the general public.Â  The collection represents 30 years of research by Jerome Handler, who passed the site to Henry Lovejoy at the University of Colorado Boulder in 2018.</p>
<p>Brumfield Labs handled the migration to the new site. This new, IIIF enabled version of Slavery Images is built on Omeka S, utilizing the IIIF-Server module built by Daniel Berthereau. It includes a new Mirador module for Omeka S, containing the final release of Mirador 2.</p>
