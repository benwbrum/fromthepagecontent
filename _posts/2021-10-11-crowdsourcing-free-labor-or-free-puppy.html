  _yoast_wpseo_metadesc: Bringing meaning to people’s lives, though, is a heavy responsibility. 
    You can’t just throw documents up and hope they get transcribed. You can, actually,
    but you’re reneging on the social contract that comes with setting up a crowdsourcing
    project.

<p><img class="wp-image-1378 alignright" title="" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2021/10/freePuppy-211x300.png" alt="" width="267" height="379" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sitting next to a senior leader of a European library at a IIIF event, he expressed concern that asking volunteers to work on transcribing was taking&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">unfair advantage of free labor.&nbsp; My internal reaction was, “you just want to keep all the good stuff for yourself!” -- but of course I didn’t say that.&nbsp; I talked about meaningful volunteer work and how -- since our very first project -- many of our volunteers were homebound for reasons of health or caretaking and transcribing brought both entertainment and meaning to their lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bringing meaning to people’s lives, though, is a heavy responsibility.&nbsp; You can’t just throw documents up and hope they get transcribed. You can, actually, but you’re reneging on the social contract that comes with setting up a crowdsourcing project. That unspoken contract says “I’m taking this seriously, so you’d better, too.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">-----</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our neighbor Michael got a new puppy recently.&nbsp; Watching him “walk” the puppy for the first time was hilarious -- and frustrating to Michael. The puppy had no idea what to do!&nbsp; Everything was new -- the street, the leash, the idea of going in a straight line instead of whichever way he wanted… And everything was so exciting it didn’t occur to him to do “his business”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A month later I heard cheering at the neighbor’s.&nbsp; “Are they having a party?”, I wondered. I peeked out my front door and noticed a dog trainer van -- they were training the puppy, and the cheering I heard was lots of positive reinforcement for what he was learning.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">-----</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As our colleague Sam Blickhan says “People think crowdsourcing is getting someone else to do their homework for them, when really you’re getting entirely different homework.”&nbsp; Effective crowdsourcing is only possible with the guidance and engagement of archives staff. You can’t replace staff members and trained information professionals with the crowd. That just doesn’t work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we introduce people to crowdsourcing we show a picture of a cute puppy because we have a standing joke.&nbsp; Crowdsourcing is not “free as in speech” or “free as in beer”, it’s “free as in puppy”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The puppy is free, but you have to take care of it; you have to do a lot of work.&nbsp; Because volunteers that participate in projects don’t like being ignored.&nbsp; They don’t like having their work lost.&nbsp; They’re doing something that they feel is meaningful and engaging with you, therefore you need to make sure their work is meaningful and engage with them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like feeding a puppy or giving him a bath, there are tasks that are part of the care and feeding of a crowdsourcing project: recruiting volunteers, welcoming them, responding to their comments and questions, making them feel appreciated, re-engaging them with regular newsletters, holding training sessions and webinars, letting them know when a project is finished and where they’ll find their work, crediting them appropriately, and reporting their service hours.&nbsp; We help with as many of these as we can, but there’s so much more we can -- and should -- do to make all of these “ancillary” tasks that come with a crowdsourcing task easier. Just like a puppy brings more companionship into your life, crowdsourcing can build community into your institution’s life.&nbsp; You just have to do the work.</span></p>
