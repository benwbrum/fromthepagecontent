<p>FromThePage is most popularly used for transcription, and transcribing primary source documents in FromThePage falls squarely within guideline 3 of the SAA/RBMS’s guidelines for primary source literacy.&nbsp; As we’ll hopefully show, though, FromThePage can also be used in conjunction with finding items in the archives and with higher level skills like summarizing and describing documents.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Julie deGraffenried is a history professor at Baylor teaching first-year history majors about early childhood education during the Progressive Era.&nbsp; She was familiar with crowdsourced transcription, and wanted to find something that would capture local interest.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So she approached Benna Vaughan, archivist at the Texas Collection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Together they were able to identify the minute books of the board of Evangelia Settlement House as appropriate.&nbsp; Evangelia Settlement provided the first childcare services for working class citizens of Waco, and the 1914-16 minutes of its board are excellent primary sources covering childcare discussions within the Progressive movement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

This past fall, I helped pilot an in-class civic engagement project for my freshman history majors.</p>
<p>Over the course of the project’s completion, my students were introduced to archives and a special collection at Baylor, introduced to FromThePage and the practice of transcription, introduced to the idea of transcription as a public service that history enthusiasts can perform for the public, and learned how big movements (like Progressivism) affected local communities.&quot;</p>

<p>This is the versions tab on a page within FromThePage for Dr. DeGraffenreid’s project; you can see on the left everyone in the classroom who worked on it; you can compare a student’s version to any of the versions that came before it.&nbsp; I also love how this shows the collaborative nature of the work in this classroom.</p>

It was very refreshing to have a project that instead of simply analyzing and writing about a selected primary source, we got to become a part of the history of the document by being the first people to officially transcribe it, albeit difficult at times. At first glance of my pages, I wholeheartedly believed that I would not be able to read half of the words. However, as I slowly chugged through the first page, I began to be able to recognize recurring letters, and the frustration I first experienced disappeared and the transcription became much easier. . . .</p>
<p>Crowdsourced transcription is a great act of civic engagement for students of history because it makes the history itself accessible to the general public. Even if someone wanted to read this document earlier, it would be very difficult for them, and likely too time-consuming for it to have been done. However, now we have digitized an accurate transcription that anyone in the world can learn from. This is important because by creating readily accessible historical documents, scholars and history enthusiasts alike can interact with the text, allowing people to uncover and connect the web that is history and furthering humanity’s understanding of the past to show us how we should address the future. Not only do current history fans benefit, but those who wrote the document and those whose work is detailed in the pages benefit. Their stories will never be lost from now on, and generations to come will easily be able to read of and respect their compassionate efforts.&quot;</p>

&quot;I have used FromThePage in the classroom to teach students about the material in question (a particular manuscript, hand or text) and have found transcription to be an enormously effective tool. In the process of transcription, students come to have a feel for the source they would not otherwise have gotten. They come to speak about the author or scribe as an individual, as they come to know the hand, how the scribe abbreviated something or the preferred letter forms; it makes the text more personal, and students appreciate it as the work of another human, not just an abstraction of ideas on a printed page.&quot;</p>

1. Find the archival collection &amp; take a selfie with it.<br />
2. “Unlocks” the collection; students transcribe a letter<br />
3. Review &amp; Edit<br />
4. Unlocks a larger collection of existing transcriptions and asks students to write a paper:  &quot;use your own transcriptions and additional transcriptions provided by me to write a formal, well-organized paper explaining why you think UT should or should not have purchased these antiquities in the 1890s.&quot;" class="wp-image-1975" /></a></figure>

<p>Dr. Rabinowitz has a fun process:<br />1. First, Students were sent into the archives of the Dolph Briscoe Center for American History at UT to find the collection of letters and take a selfie with one of them, proving they can navigate a finding aid and work with the archives staff to see primary source material.<br />2. Then Dr. Rabinowitz "unlocks" the collection of letters for the class to transcribe by adding the students to a private collection in FromThePage.<br />3. He then reviews and edits their work.<br />4. Finally, he gives them access to a larger collection of already transcribed letters in this collection and asks them to write a paper.</p>

<p>I also think there’s potential using transcription in STEM classrooms, although we haven’t seen that yet.. Geometry Notebook at Davidson College, Historical Chemistry Research Notes from Stanford.&nbsp; There are also a lot of historical field books and scientific observations -- that are useful to look at environmental and species change over time that would be interesting projects for the classroom.</p>

<p>This is an example page from the Baylor project.&nbsp; Remember, this was a freshman history class -- arguably the youngest and least cursive-exposed students on campus.&nbsp; It’s from the 1910s, which is something to keep in mind -- the further back you go the harder the cursive is to read.&nbsp; This is pretty clear.&nbsp; These were also&nbsp; freshman history majors -- so they were perhaps more motivated than your average student in a distribution class.</p>

<p>So a lot of our recommendations are to lean into that collaboration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Baylor did the first; they put a page up on a screen on the front of the classroom and worked on it together.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Pairing works well with elderly handwriting readers + tech savvy youngsters, but just having someone to work with takes some of the pressure off.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you work on this some -- or entirely -- in class, then students will have a stronger support -- from each other, even.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Encourage using the “notes” field to have students ask for help.</p>

<p>These are more examples from the Baylor project; on the left you see the “Notes and Questions” area that’s at the bottom of every transcription screen, and we see Sophia making a note about a hard to read name….&nbsp; And then coming back later, when she has more information from a later document, to confirm her first read of the text.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For every project we show the notes on the right side of the project page, and you can encourage students to leave notes on the page and to help each other out.</p>

Virtuous Cycle; Meaningful Work</p>
<p>“Integrating transcription work into students coursework can also create a productive feedback loop between student researchers and Special Collections, as we re-integrate their work into the archives.<br />
When students know their work will become an integral part of the archives, the same assignment can offer them the satisfaction of making tangible contributions to a broader enterprise, and illustrates the iterative nature of scholarship and the labor of knowledge production as a praxis. For the archivist, of course, collaborating with students and instructors means that the more our collections are used, the more they are enriched.”<br />

<p>The first is Voyant, which can give you many different ways of text mining, from word clouds on up.&nbsp; It’s really user-friendly way to explore texts computationally, and it might provide some justification for the effort of transcription.</p>

<p>This was a graduate student seminar at the Catholic University of America, taught by Dr. Laura Morreale, where they looked at how time was represented in a medieval text from Pisa.&nbsp; They used an anonymous fourteenth-century chronicle from Pisa, Italy that focused on internal Pisan governance and factional conflict in Northern Italy.</p>

<p>This was particularly interesting because they pulled in the manuscript from the British Library and transcribed it and they pulled an early printed text from the Internet Archive and used FromThePage to correct the OCR.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Material doesn’t have to come from your institution! In fact, these two texts were super easy to import into FromThePage because they both were published using IIIF, so Dr. Morreale only had to copy and paste a URL to get them in.</p>
