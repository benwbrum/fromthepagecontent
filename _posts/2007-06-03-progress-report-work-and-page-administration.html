<p>As I said earlier, I've been making really good progress writing the kinds of administrative features that Rails excels at.  Despite my digression to implement <a href="http://manuscripttranscription.blogspot.com/2007/05/progress-zoom.html">zoom</a>, in the last two weeks I've added code for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Converting a set of titled images into a work composed of pages</li>
<li>Creating a new, blank work</li>
<li>Editing title and description information about a work</li>
<li>Deleting a work</li>
<li>Viewing the list of pages within a work and their status</li>
<li>Re-ording those pages within the list</li>
<li>Adding a new page</li>
<li>Editing or deleting a page</li>
<li>Rotating, and re-scaling the image on a page</li>
<li>Uploading a replacement image for a page</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these are really very sexy, but they're all powerful.  The fact that I was able to implement page re-ordering, new work creation, new page creation, and page deletion from start to finish during my daughter's nap today — in addition to refactoring my tab UI and completing image uploads — reminds me of why I love Ruby on Rails.</p>
