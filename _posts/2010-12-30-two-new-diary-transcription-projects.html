<p>The last few weeks have seen the announcement of two new transcription projects.  I'm particularly excited about them because--like <a href="http://beta.fromthepage.com/">FromThePage</a>--their manuscripts are diaries and they plan to open the transcription tasks to the public.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.lib.uiowa.edu/dls/2010/11/22/dear-diary/"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Dear Diary</span></a> announces the digitization of University of Iowa's <a href="http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/diaries/index.php">Historic Iowa Children's Diaries:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>We have a deep love for historic diaries as well, and we’re currently hard at work developing a site that will allow the public to help enhance our collections through “crowdsourcing” or collaborative transcription of diaries and other manuscript materials. Stay tuned!</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://blogs.getty.edu/iris/a-look-inside-j-paul-getty-newly-digitized-diaries/"><b>A Look Inside J. Paul Getty’s Newly Digitized Diaries</b></a> describes J. Paul Getty's diaries and their contents, and mentions in passing that</p>
<blockquote><p>We will soon launch a website that will invite your participation to perform the transcriptions (via crowdsourcing), thus rendering the diaries keyword-searchable and dramatically improving their accessibility.</p></blockquote>
<p>I will be very interested to follow these projects and see which transcription systems they use or develop.</p>
