<p>As predicted earlier, real life has consumed 100% of my energy for the last month or so, so I haven't made any progress on <a href="http://manuscripttranscription.blogspot.com/search/label/names"><span>RefineScript</span>/The <span>Straightstone</span></a> System/curingbarn.com/ManuscriptForge.  I have, however, listened to some <span>podcasts</span> that I think are relevant to anyone else in my situation<sup>*</sup>, so I think I'll start a series of reviews.</p>
<p>"When Communities Attack!" was presented at <span>SXSWi</span>07 by Chris <span>Tolles</span>, marketing director for <span>Topix</span>.net.  You can <a href="http://audio.sxsw.com/podcast/interactive/panel/2007/SXSW07.INT.20070312.WhenCommunitiesAttack.mp3">download the MP3</a> at the <span>SXSW</span> Podcast website.</p>
<p>The talk covered the lessons learned about online communities through running a large-scale current-events message board system.  <span>Topix</span>.net really seemed like it had  been a crucible for user-created content, as Danish users argued with Yemenis about the Mohamed cartoons, or neighbors bickered with each other about cleaning up the local trailer park.</p>
<p>These were the points I thought relevant to my comment feature:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Give your site a purpose and encourage good behavior.</span>  Rather than discourage bad behavior, if your site has a purpose (like <span>wikipedia</span>) users have a metric to use to police themselves.  Even debatable behavior can be tested against whether it helps transcribe the manuscript.  This also prevents administrators from only acting as nags.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Geo-tag posts.</span>  Display the physical location where the comment comes from: <span style="font-style: italic;">"The commentary now <span>autotags</span> where the commenter is from. . . .  The tone of the entire forum got a little more friendly once you start putting <span>someone's</span> town name next to [a post], because it turns out that no-one wants to bring shame to their town.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Anonymity breeds bad behavior.</span>  If people think their mother will read what they're writing, they're less likely to fly off the handle.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Don't erect time-consuming barriers to posting</span>.  It turns out that malevolent users have more free time than constructive users, and are actually more likely to register on the site and jump through hoops.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Management needs a presence</span>.  Like a beat cop, just making yourself visible encourages good behavior.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Expose user information like <span>IP</span> address</span>.  This can help the community police itself through shaming posters who use sock-puppet accounts.</li>
</ul>
<p>[*] that is, any other micro-<span>ISV</span> building on collaboration software for the digital humanities.</p>
