<p>I'm going to <a href="http://thatcamp.org/">THATCamp</a> at the end of May to talk about From The Page and a few dozen other cool projects that are going on in the digital humanities.  If anybody can offer advice on what to expect from an "unconference", I'd sure appreciate it.</p>
<p>This may be the thing that finally drives me to use Twitter.</p>
