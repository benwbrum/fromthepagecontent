<p><a href="http://content.fromthepage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/800px-Michel_Zeno_Diemer_-_The_Ah覺rkap覺_Lighthouse_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-417 size-full" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2017/03/800px-Michel_Zeno_Diemer_-_The_Ah%C4%B1rkap%C4%B1_Lighthouse_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg" alt="800px-Michel_Zeno_Diemer_-_The_Ah覺rkap覺_Lighthouse_-_Google_Art_Project" width="800" height="598" /></a></p>
<p><em>One of our recent projects on FromThePage is the <a href="http://fromthepage.com/YaquinaLights">Yaquina Lighthouse Collection</a> of documents from the National Archive.&nbsp; I helped the team at Yaquina brainstorm ways to publicize their project and wanted to share that process here as well.&nbsp; This was in addition to their existing Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram publicity.</em></p>
<p>I would contact the people/groups you find below with the project link and a short bit of text that explains what you are trying to do. (Make it easy on them -- write their post/email/etc for them!) I would tailor it to each group based on their interest.</p>
<p>1) location or family name genealogy<br />
-- rootsweb "surname lists": <a href="http://rsl.rootsweb.ancestry.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://rsl.rootsweb.ancestry.com/</a><br />
-- search on facebook for surname + "family association" "Graves Family Association"<br />
-- search for Statename + Genweb, i.e. "Oregon GenWeb". <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/%7Eorgenweb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~orgenweb/</a></p>
<p>2) Lighthouse Interest Groups on Facebook:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Lighthouses-43343592942/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.facebook.com/Lighthouses-43343592942/</a><br />
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/uslighthousescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.facebook.com/uslighthousescom/</a><br />
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Lighthouses-of-North-America-426590840685801/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.facebook.com/Lighthouses-of-North-America-426590840685801/</a></p>
<p>3) Of course, your local history groups and local library -- perhaps the library would let you post your flyer? Or would one of them be interested in a presentation on the materials, the project, what you've found so far?</p>
<p>4) Websites: <a href="http://www.lighthousefriends.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://www.lighthousefriends.com/</a> (has an email at the bottom)<br />
When you find a good match in Google, you can right click on the URL (<a href="http://www.lighthousefriends.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">www.lighthousefriends.com</a> in this example) and Google gives you a "similar" option.</p>
<p><a href="http://content.fromthepage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lighthousegoogle.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-407 size-full" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2017/03/lighthousegoogle.png" alt="Finding Similar Pages in Google" width="717" height="147" /></a></p>
<p>Doing this gave me the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?safe=active&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;hs=7TR&amp;channel=fs&amp;biw=1855&amp;bih=983&amp;q=related:www.lighthousefriends.com/+lighthouse+fans&amp;tbo=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwie1LHL_vbRAhVn1oMKHYtnBJsQHwgmMAE">following search results</a>, which has a lot of potential matches for you. If they have a "news" section or a blog, they likely are willing to post about your project. Once you find a good match, look for a "contact" link (usually at the bottom of the page) or a facebook page you can message them via (look for the "message" button) or a twitter account (tweet at them by using their twitter id, like: "<span class="atMention" title="uslhs">@uslhs</span> we thought you might like our new project &lt;link&gt;").</p>
