<p>Now that I'm done with development driven only by my sense of what would be a good feature, it's time to move to step #2 in my year-old <a href="http://manuscripttranscription.blogspot.com/2007/04/maiden-voyage-plan.html">feature plan</a>: deploying an alpha site.</p>
<p>I'm no longer certain about the second half of that plan -- other projects have presented themselves as opportunities that might have a more technically sophisticated user base, and thus might present more incremental enhancement requests.  But getting the app to a server where I can follow <a href="http://www.baychi.org/podcast/20060808a/baychi-20060808a-35.mp3">Matt Mullenweg's advice</a> and "become [my] most passionate user" seems more sensible now than ever.</p>
