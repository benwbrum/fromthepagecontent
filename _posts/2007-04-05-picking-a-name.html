<p>When I started working on this piece of software back in 2005, I referred to it as "the diary project."  Realizing that this would almost certainly result in a collision, I settled on "The Julia Project" as a far more elegant name.</p>
<p>A quick <span>Google</span> search reveals that most variations of "Julia" with "Project" or "System" are taken, most recently by a film production company.  So now I'm left with either the unlovely <span>CMTAS</span> or referring to the system by a name I know I'll have to abandon.  Fortunately, I'll only have to decide after signing up for hosting or starting a formal <span>RubyForge</span> project, so I can put off the decision.</p>
