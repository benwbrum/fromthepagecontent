<p>Well, that was fast!</p>
<p>Four days after <a href="http://manuscripttranscription.blogspot.com/2007/06/progress-report-transcription-access.html">announcing</a> that this blog would take a speculative turn (read "stall") while I spent months on article links, linking pages to articles works!</p>
<p>It only took me about ten hours of coding and research to learn to use the XML parser, write the article and link schema, process typed transcriptions into a canonical XML form with appropriate RDBMS updates, and transform that into HTML when displaying a page. In fact, the most difficult part was adding support for WikiMedia-style square-brace links.</p>
<p>After implementing the article links, it only took 15 minutes of transcription to discover that automated linking is a MUST-DO feature, rather than the NICE-TO-HAVE priority I'd assigned it. It's miserable to type [[Sally Joseph Carr Brumfield|Josie]] every time Julia mentions the daughter-in-law who lives with her.</p>
