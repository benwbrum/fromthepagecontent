<p>Both my friends <a href="http://aprendizdetodo.com/">Prentiss Riddle</a> and <a href="http://www.apaclassics.org/AnnualMeeting/05mtg/abstracts/george.html">Coulter George</a><br />
have suggested that I resolve my software name quandry by looking for placenames in Julia Brumfield's diaries.  I like this suggestion, since it retains the connection to the project's origin and has potential for uniqueness.  The most frequently mentioned placenames in the diaries are "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renan%2C_Virginia">Renan</a>", "Straightstone", "Mount Airy", "Long Island", and "Cedar Forest".</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Long Island</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Mount Airy</span> are probably each so common that they'll have the same problems that <span style="font-style:italic;">Julia</span> does.  <span style="font-style:italic;">Renan</span>, on the other hand, has a neat connection to collaboration:  Ernest Renan is now most famous for his definition of a nation as "having done great things together and wishing to do more."</p>
<p>So maybe "Renanscript" or "Renanscribe"?</p>
