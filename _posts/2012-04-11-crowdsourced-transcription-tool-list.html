<p>When I first started this blog, I spent a lot of time writing detailed reviews of different transcription projects.&nbsp; This has become difficult as my available time shrinks and the number of crowdsourcing projects grows.&nbsp; So when Kate Bowers <a href="http://forums.archivists.org/read/messages?id=77267">posted</a> to the Society of American Archivists mailing list asking for a directory of transcription tools, I figured it was time to take a different approach.</p>

<p>The link above is a Google Documents spreadsheet listing different tools and the features I thought were relevant.  It's been updated several times over the last few weeks, and I'm pleased to see that it's expanded to include a score of technologies.  I hope it's useful.</p>
