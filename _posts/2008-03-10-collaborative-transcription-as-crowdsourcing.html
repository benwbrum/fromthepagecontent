<p>Yesterday morning I saw Derek Powazek present on crowdsourcing -- user-generated content and collaborative communities. While he covered a lot of material that (users will do unexpected things, don't exploit people, design for the "selfish user"), there was one anecdote I thought especially relevant for FromThePage.</p>
<p>A publishing house had polled a targeted group of people to figure out whether they'd be interested in contributing magazine articles. The response was overwhelmingly positive. The appropriate studies were conducted, and the site was launched -- A blank page, ready for article contributions.</p>
<p>The response from those previously enthusiastic users was silence. Crickets. Tumbleweeds. The editors quickly changed tack and posted a list of ten subjects who'd agreed to be interviewed by the site's contributors,<br />
asking for volunteers to conduct and write up the interviews. This time, people responded with the same enthusiasm they'd shown at the original survey.</p>
<p>The lesson was that successful editors of collaborative content endeavorshave less in common with traditional magazine/project editors thanthey do with community managers. Absent thecommand-and-control organizational structure, a volunteer community still needs to have its effortsdirected. However, this must be done through guidance andpersuasion through concrete suggestions, goal-setting, and feedback. In future releases, I need to add featuresto help work owners communicate suggestions and rewards<a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=5730930067468816440&amp;postID=8265518173646723285#note-1"><sup>*</sup></a> to scribes.</p>
<p>(Powazek suggests attaboys, not complex replacements for currency here)</p>
