<p>Back in June, the folks at IMLS and Heritage Preservation ran a webinar exploring the issues and tools discussed at the IMLS Webwise Crowdsourcing panel "<b>Sharing Public History Work: Crowdsourcing Data and Sources."</b></p>
<p>After a introduction by Kevin Cherry and Kristen Laise,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.6floors.org/bracket/">Sharon Leon</a>, who chaired the live panel, presented a wonderful overview of crowdsourcing cultural heritage and discussed the kinds of crowdsourcing projects that have been successful -- including, of course, the <a href="http://wardepartmentpapers.org/">Papers of the War Department</a> and <a href="http://scripto.org/">Scripto</a>, the transcription tool the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media developed from that project.&nbsp; They then ran the <a href="http://www.tvworldwide.com/events/webwise/120229/globe_show/default_go_archive.cfm?gsid=1971&amp;type=flv&amp;test=0&amp;live=0">video </a>of my own presentation, <a href="http://manuscripttranscription.blogspot.com/2012/03/crowdsourcing-at-imls-webwise-2012.html">"Lessons from Small Crowdsourcing Projects"</a>, followed by a live demo of <a href="http://fromthepage.com/">FromThePage</a>.&nbsp; Perhaps the best part of the webinar, however, was the Q&amp;A from people all over the country asking for details about how these kinds of projects work.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.connectingtocollections.org/2012-webwise-crowdsourcing/">recording of the webinar</a> is online, and I encourage you to check it out.&nbsp; (Here's a <a href="http://squirrel.adobeconnect.com/p1wspy893ub/">direct link</a>, if you have trouble.) I'm very grateful to IMLS and Heritage Preservation for their work in making this knowledge accessible so effectively.</p>
