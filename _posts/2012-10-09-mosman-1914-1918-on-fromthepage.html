<p>The Mosman community in New South Wales is preparing for the centennial of World War One, and as part of this project they've launched <a href="http://mosman1914-1918.net/">mosman1914-1918.net</a>: "Doing our bit, Mosman 1914â€“1918".&nbsp; The project describes itself as "an innovative online resource to collect and display information about the wartime experiences of local service people," and includes scan-a-thons, hack days, and build-a-thons.</p>
<p>One of their efforts involves <a href="http://fromthepage.com/collection/show?collection_id=12">transcription of a serviceman's diary with links to related names on local honor boards</a>.&nbsp; I'm delighted to report that they're hosting this project on <a href="http://fromthepage.com/">FromThePage.com</a>, and I look forward to working with and learning from the Mosman team.</p>
<p>Read more about Allan Allsop's diary on the <a href="http://mosman1914-1918.net/project/blog/help-us-transcribe-this-diary">Mosman 1914-1918 project blog</a> and lend a hand transcribing!</p>
