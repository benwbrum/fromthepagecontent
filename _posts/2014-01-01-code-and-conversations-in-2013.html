<p><i>It's often hard to explain what it is that I do, so perhaps a list of what I did will help.&nbsp; Inspired by Tim Sherratt's "<a href="http://discontents.com.au/2012-the-talking/">talking</a>" and "<a href="http://discontents.com.au/2012-the-making/">making</a>" posts at the end of 2012, here's my 2013.</i>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Code</h3>
<p>I work on a number of software projects, whether as contract developer, <i>pro bono</i> "code fairy", or product owner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4>FromThePage</h4>
<p>It's been a big year for <b>FromThePage</b>, my open-source tool for manuscript transcription and annotation.&nbsp; We started work upgrading the tool to Rails 3, and built a <b>TEI Export</b> (see <a href="http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A1=ind1310&amp;L=TEI-L&amp;X=043CCE6BA8E3012F7A#14">discussion on the TEI-L</a>) and an exploratory <b>Omeka integration</b>.&nbsp; Several institutions (including University of Delaware and the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology) launched trials on FromThePage.com for material ranging from naturalist field notes to Civil War diaries.&nbsp; Pennsylvania State University joined the ranks of on-site FromThePage installations with their "<a href="http://zebrapedia.psu.edu/#!/">Zebrapedia</a>", transcribing <b>Philip K. Dick</b>'s <i>Exegesis</i> -- initially as a class project and now as an <a href="http://zebrapedia.psu.edu/deed/list?collection_id=1">ongoing work of participatory scholarship</a>.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting developments of 2013 was that customizations and enhancements to FromThePage were written into three grant applications.&nbsp; These enhancements--if funded--would add significant features to the tool, including Fedora integration, authority file import, redaction of transcripts and facsimiles, and support for externally-hosted images.&nbsp; All these features would be integrated into the FromThePage source, benefiting everybody.</p>
<p>Two other collaborations this year promise interesting developments in 2014.&nbsp; The <a href="http://blogs.library.duke.edu/dcthree/">Duke Collaboratory for Classics Computing</a> (DC3) will be pushing the tool to support 19th-century women's travel diaries and Byzantine liturgical texts, both of which require more sophisticated encoding than the tool currently supports.&nbsp; (Expect <b>Unicode support</b> by Valentine's Day.)&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.austinfanzineproject.org/blog/">Austin Fanzine Project</a> will be using a new <b><a href="http://eac.staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/">EAC-CPF</a> export</b> which I'll deliver by mid-January.</p>
<h4>OpenSourceIndexing / FreeREG 2</h4>
<p>Most of my work this year has been focused on improving the <b><a href="https://github.com/FreeUKGen/MyopicVicar">new search engine</a></b> for the twenty-six million church register entries the <a href="http://www.freereg.org.uk/">FreeREG</a> organization has assembled in CSV files over the last decade and a half.&nbsp; In the spring, I integrated the parsed CSV records into the search engine and converted our ORM to Mongoid.&nbsp; I also launched the <b><a href="http://opensourceindexing.org/">Open Source Indexing</a></b> Github page to rally developers around the project and began collecting case studies from historical and genealogical organizations.</p>
<p>In May, I built a <a href="https://github.com/FreeUKGen/MyopicVicar/blob/master/lib/date_parser.rb">parser for historical dates</a> into the search engine I'm building for FreeREG.&nbsp; It handles split  dates like "4 Jan 1688/9", illegible date portions in UCF like "4 Jan  165_", and preserves the verbatim transcription as well as  programmatically handling searching and sorting correctly.&nbsp; Eventually  I'll incorporate this into an <a href="https://github.com/benwbrum/antique_date">antique_date</a> gem for general use.</p>
<p>Most of the fall was spent adding GIS search capabilities to the search engine.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, my <a href="https://github.com/FreeUKGen/MyopicVicar/commit/703f178afc1a12fa4e7f4b52eb3f4259508840e7">last commit of the year</a> added the ability to search for records within a radius of a place.&nbsp; The new year will bring more developments on GIS features, since an effective and easy interface to a geocoded database is just as big a challenge as the geocoding logic itself.</p>
<h4>Other Projects</h4>
<p>In January I added a command-line wrapper to <b><a href="https://github.com/benwbrum/autosplit">Autosplit</a></b>, my library for automatically detecting the spine in a two-page flatbed scan and splitting the image into recto and verso halves.&nbsp; In addition to making the tool more usable, it also added support for notebook-bound books which must be split top-to-bottom rather than left-to-right.</p>
<p>For the <a href="http://fromthepage.wpengine.com/idigbio-augmenting-ocr-hackathon/">iDigBio Augmenting OCR Hackathon</a> in February, I worked on two exploratory software projects.&nbsp; <b>HandwritingDetection</b> (<a href="https://github.com/idigbio-aocr/HandwritingDetection">code</a>, <a href="http://fromthepage.wpengine.com/detecting-handwriting-in-ocr-text/">write-up</a>) analyzes OCR text to look for patterns characteristically produced when OCR tools encounter handwriting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>LabelExtraction</b> (<a href="https://github.com/idigbio-aocr/LabelExtraction">code</a>, <a href="http://fromthepage.wpengine.com/results-of-the-ocrocrop-approach-to-improving-ocr/">write-up</a>) parses OCR-generated bounding boxes and text to identify labels on specimen images.&nbsp; To my delight, in October part of this second tool was <a href="https://github.com/idhmc-tamu/LabelExtraction">generalized</a> by Matt Christy at the <a href="http://idhmc.tamu.edu/">IDHMC</a> to illustrate OCR bounding boxes for the eMOP project's work tuning OCR algorithms for Early Modern English books.</p>
<p>In June and July, I started working on the <b>Digital Austin Papers</b>, contract development work for Andrew Torget at the University of North Texas.&nbsp; This was what freelancers call a "rescue" project, as the <a href="https://github.com/DigitalAustinPapers/DigitalAustinSite">digital edition software</a> had been mostly written but was still in an exploratory state when the previous programmer left.&nbsp; My job was to triage features, then turn off anything half-done and non-essential, complete anything half-done and essential, and QA and polish core pieces that worked well.&nbsp; I think we're all pretty happy with the results, and hope to push the site to production in early 2014.&nbsp; I'm particularly excited about exposing the TEI XML through the delivery system as well as <a href="https://github.com/DigitalAustinPapers/AustinTranscripts">via GitHub</a> for bulk re-use.</p>
<p>Also in June, I worked on a <i>pro bono</i> project with the Civil War-era census and service records from Pittsylvania County, Virginia which were collected by Jeff McClurken in his research.&nbsp; My goal is to make the <b><a href="https://github.com/benwbrum/PittsylvaniaCivilWarVets">PittsylvaniaCivilWarVets</a></b> database freely available for both public and scholarly use. &nbsp; Most of the work remaining here is HTML/CSS formatting, and I'd welcome volunteers to help with that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In November, I contributed <a href="https://github.com/lmullen/omeka_client/pull/1">some modifications</a> to Lincoln Mullen's <b>Omeka client for ruby</b>.&nbsp; The client should now support read-only interactions with the Omeka API for files, as well as being a bit more robust.</p>
<p>December offered the opportunity to spend a couple of days building a tool for reconciling multi-keyed transcripts produced from the NotesFromNature citizen science UI.&nbsp; One of the things this effort taught me was how difficult it is to find corresponding transcript to reconcile -- a very different problem from reconciliation itself.&nbsp; The project itself is over, but <b><a href="https://github.com/idigbio-citsci-hackathon/ReconciliationUI">ReconciliationUI</a></b> is still deployed on the <a href="http://citscribe.aspengrovefarm.com/">development site</a>.</p>

<p>September 12 -- <b>University of Southern Mississippi</b>. <i>"Crowdsourcing and Transcription".</i>&nbsp; <i>An introduction to crowdsourced transcription for a general audience. </i></p>
<p>September 20 -- Interview with <b>Nathan Raab</b> for Forbes.com.&nbsp; <i>Nathan and I had a great conversation, although his article <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanraab/2013/09/20/technology-offers-organizations-new-ways-to-engage-the-public-in-history/">"Crowdsourcing Technology Offers Organizations New Ways to Engage Public in History"</a> was mostly finished by that point, so my contributions were minor.&nbsp; His focus on the engagement and outreach aspects of crowdsourcing and its implications for fundraising is one to watch in 2014.</i></p>
<p>September 25 -- <b>Wisconsin Historical Society</b>.&nbsp; <i>"The Crowdsourced Transcription Landscape".&nbsp; Same presentation as USM, with minor changes based on their questions.&nbsp; Contents: 1.

<p>November 1-2 -- <a href="http://www.txsgs.org/about/conference/"><b>Texas State Genealogy Society Conference</b></a> in Round Rock, Texas.&nbsp; <i>Attempting to explore public interest in transcribing their own family documents, I set up as an exhibitor, striking up conversations with attendees and demoing FromThePage.&nbsp; The minority of attendees who possessed family papers were receptive, and in some cases enthusiastic about producing amateur editions.&nbsp; Many of them had already scanned in their family documents and were wondering what to do next.&nbsp; That said, privacy and access control was a very big concern -- especially with more recent material which mentioned living people.</i></p>
<p>November 7 -- <a href="http://dhlib2013.thatcamp.org/"><b>THATCamp Digital Humanities &amp; Libraries</b></a> in Austin, Texas. <i>Great conversations about CMS APIs and GIS visualization tools.</i></p>
<p>November 19-20 -- <b>Duke University</b>.&nbsp; <i>I worked with my hosts at the Duke Collaboratory for Classics Computing to transcribe a 19th-century travel diary using FromThePage, then spoke on "The Landscape of Crowdsourcing and Transcription", an expansion of my talks at USM and WHS.&nbsp; (See a <a href="http://fromthepage.wpengine.com/the-landscape-of-crowdsourcing-and-transcription-at-duke-university/">longer write-up and video</a>.)</i></p>
<p>December 17-20 -- <a href="http://blog.notesfromnature.org/2013/12/23/citscribe-notes-from-nature-hackathon/"><b>iDigBio Citizen Science Hackathon</b></a>.&nbsp; <i>Due to schedule conflicts, I wasn't able to attend this in person, but followed the conversations on the <a href="https://www.idigbio.org/wiki/index.php/Transcription_Hackathon">wiki</a> and the collaborative Google docs.&nbsp; For the hackathon, I built <a href="https://github.com/idigbio-citsci-hackathon/ReconciliationUI">ReconciliationUI</a>, a Ruby on Rails app for reconciling different NotesFromNature-produced transcripts of the same image on the model of FamilySearch Indexing's arbitration tool.</i></p>
<h3>2014</h3>
<p>All these projects promise to keep me busy in the new year, though I anticipate taking on more development work in the summer and fall.&nbsp; If you're interested in collaborating with me in 2014--whether to give a talk, work on a software project, or just chat about crowdsourcing and transcription--please <a href="http://fromthepage.wpengine.com/p/contact-me.html">get in touch</a>.</p>
