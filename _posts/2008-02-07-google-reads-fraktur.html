<p>Yesterday, German blogger Archivalia <a href="http://archiv.twoday.net/stories/4684762/">reported</a> that the quality of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraktur_%28typeface_sub-classification%29">Fraktur</a> OCR at Google Books has improved.  There are still some problems, but they're on the same order of those found in books printed in Antiqua.  Compare the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=IgIOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA88&amp;dq=bierbrauen+date:1700-1800&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;hl=de&amp;output=text">text-only</a> and <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=IgIOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA88&amp;dq=bierbrauen+date:1700-1800&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;hl=de">page-image</a> versions of <i>Geschichte der teutschen Landwirthschaft</i> (1800) with the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=KHU2AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=bierbrauen+date:1800-1900&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;hl=de&amp;output=text">text</a> and <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=KHU2AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=bierbrauen+date:1800-1900&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;hl=de&amp;output=text">image</a> versions of Antigua <i>Altnordisches Leben</i> (1856).</p>
<p>This is a big deal, since previous OCR efforts produced results that were not only unreadable, but <a href="http://archiv.twoday.net/stories/2609488/">un-searchable as well</a>.  This <a href="http://mdp.lib.umich.edu/cgi/m/mdp/pt?seq=200;size=100;id=mdp.39015014807104;view=text;page=root;orient=0">example</a> from the University of Michigan's MBooks website (digitized in partnership with Google) gives a flavor of the prior quality: <b>"Ueber den Ursprung des Uebels."</b> ("On the Origin of Evil") results in <b>"Us-Wv ben Uvfprun@ - bed Its-beEd."</b></p>
<p>It's thrilling that these improvements are being made to the big digitization efforts — my guess is that they've added new blackletter typefaces to the OCR algorithm and reprocessed the previously-scanned images — but this highlights the dependency OCR technology has on well-known typefaces.  Occasionally, when I tell friends about my software and the diaries I'm transcribing, I'm asked, "Why don't you just OCR the diaries?"  Unfortunately, until someone comes with a OCR plugin for Julia Brumfield (age 72) and another for Julia Brumfield (age 88), we'll be stuck transcribing the diaries by hand.</p>
