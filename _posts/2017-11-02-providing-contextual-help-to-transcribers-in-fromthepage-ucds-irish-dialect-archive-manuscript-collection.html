<p>Many transcription project owners need the ability to explain how to transcribe the special nuances of their material. &nbsp;FromThePage project owners have the ability to configure transcription help within FromThePage; that help can be extensive. &nbsp;An example of an extensive transcription help screen is in <a href="https://fromthepage.com/jbhoward/irish-dialect-archive-manuscript-collection/seanchas-cuimhni-cinn-by-sean-o-dalaigh/transcribe/20905">University College Dublinâ€™s Irish Dialect Archive collection</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://content.fromthepage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-from-2017-11-02-084108.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-533 size-full" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2017/11/Screenshot-from-2017-11-02-084108.png" alt="" width="1604" height="1020" /></a></p>
<p>The help appears immediately below the transcription text box, so all a transcriber has to do is scroll down to get answer their question.&nbsp; In order to do this extensive help, UCD had to host their images on another server, and reference them in the html for the transcription help.</p>
<p>If you'd like to see the exact source of UCD's transcription conventions, I've <a href="https://gist.github.com/saracarl/16c6dfba01ba0ce04d77e0c07515cba3">published them here for reference</a>.</p>
<p>Don't let our suggested transcription conventions limit what you can provide your volunteers -- anything that keeps a volunteer from getting stumped and frustrated can keep them coming back.</p>
