<p>The deprecation tools for Rails 2.0 are grand, but they really don't tell you everything you need to know.  The things that have bitten me so far are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The built-in pagination has been removed from the core framework.  Unlike tools like acts_as_list and acts_as_tree, however, there's no obvious plugin that makes the old code work.  This is because the old pagination code was really awful: it performed poorly and hid your content from search engines.  Fortunately, Sara was able to convert my <code>paginate</code> calls to use the <code>will_paginate</code> plugin pretty easily.</li>
<li>Rails Engines, or at least the restful_comments plugin built on top of them, don't seem to work at all.  So I've had to disable the comments and proofreading request system I spent November through January building.</li>
<li>Rails 2.0 adds some spiffy automated code to prevent cross-site-scripting security holes.  For some reason this breaks my cross-controller AJAX calls, so I've had to add<br />
<blockquote><p><code>protect_from_forgery :except =&gt; [<i>my old actions</i>]</code></p></blockquote>
<p>to those controllers after  getting <span>InvalidAuthenticityToken</span> exceptions.</li>
<li>The default session has been changed from a <span>filesystem</span>-based storage engine to one that shoves session data into the browser cookie.  So if you're persisting large-<span>ish</span> objects across requests in the session, this will fail.  Sadly, basic tests may pass, while serious work will break: I found my bulk page transformation<br />
code to work fine for 20 pages, but break for 180. The solution for this is to add <code></code></p>
<blockquote><p><code> config.action_controller.session_store = :p_store</code></p></blockquote>
<p>in your environment.<span>rb</span> file.</li>
</ul>
