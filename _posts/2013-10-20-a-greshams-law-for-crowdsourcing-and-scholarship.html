<p><i>This is a comment I wanted to make at Neil Fraistat's "Participatory DH" session (<a href="http://leadership2013.thatcamp.org/2013/10/09/participatory-dh/">proposal</a>, <a href="http://leadership2013.thatcamp.org/notepads/participatory-dh-crowdsourcing-public-dh/">notes</a>) at THATCamp Leadership, but ended up having on twitter instead.</i></p>
<p><i>Much of the discussion in the first half of the session focused on the qualitative difference between the activities we ask amateurs to do and the activities performed by scholars.&nbsp; One concern voiced was that we're not asking "citizen scholars" to do real scholarly work, and then labeling their activity scholarship -- a concern <a href="http://fromthepage.wpengine.com/the-collaborative-future-of-amateur-editions/">I share with regard to editing</a>.&nbsp; If most crowdsourcing projects ask amateurs to do little more than wash test tubes, where are the projects that solicit scholarly interpretation?</i></p>
<p>The Harry Ransom Center's <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ransom_center_fragments/">Manuscript Fragments Project</a> is just such a crowdsourcing project, and I think the results may be disquieting.&nbsp; In this project, fragments of medieval manuscripts reused as binding for printed books are photographed and posted on Flickr.&nbsp; Volunteers <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ransom_center_fragments/8598025488?initial-comments-show=9#comments">use the comments</a> to identify the fragments, discussing the scribal hand and researching the source texts. I'd argue that while this does not duplicate the full range of an academic medievalist's scholarly activities, it's certainly not just "bottle-washing" either.</p>
<p>The project has been very successful.&nbsp; (See organizer <a href="http://micahcapstone.wordpress.com/">Micah Erwin's talks</a> for details.)&nbsp; Most of the contributions to the project have been made on Flickr in the comments by a few "super volunteers" -- retired rare book dealers and graduate students among them.&nbsp; However, around 20% of the identifications were made by professional medievalists who learned about the project, visited the Flickr site, and then <b>called or emailed the project organizer</b>.&nbsp; None of their contributions were made on the public Flickr forum at all.</p>
<p>So why did professional scholars avoid contributing in public?&nbsp; I related this on Twitter, and got some interesting suggestions</p>
<blockquote><p>Either the forum (flickr) or the 'public' nature of the project made them lurkers and silent back-channel (email/phone) contributors.<br />

<blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/benwbrum">@benwbrum</a> noticed phenomnw/ <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23keteweb&amp;src=hash">#keteweb</a> collab. Many librarians seemed scared to put professional rep on the line by asking questions publicly.<br />

<blockquote><p>Maybe if you do involve/invite the public, you drive out the professionals for social reasons? <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23crowdsourcing&amp;src=hash">#crowdsourcing</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23digitalhumanities&amp;src=hash">#digitalhumanities</a><br />

<blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/benwbrum">@benwbrum</a> or social networks of academia haven't yet made transition into digital? Also issues of peer review/perf frameworks. Interesting.<br />

<blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/benwbrum">@benwbrum</a> Does elitism factor in? Academics don't want to participate in a public comments section, to be seen as "non-scholarly?"<br />

<blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/benwbrum">@benwbrum</a> Or ego preservation? If "a bunch of amateurs" can do the same work at the same quality, what good was all this education?<br />

<blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/benwbrum">@benwbrum</a> Or effort avoidance? If a public discussion by amateurs *is* scholarly, then do they have to cite it? Provide credit? Preserve it?<br />

<p>Many of these suggest a sort of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law">Gresham's Law</a> of crowdsourcing, in which inviting the public to participate in an activity lowers that activity's status, driving out professionals concerned with their reputation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's a more reassuring explanation as well -- many people with domain expertise still aren't very comfortable with technology.&nbsp; Asking them to use a public forum puts additional pressure on them, as any mistakes typing, encoding, and using the forum will be public and likely permanent.&nbsp; This challenge is not confined to professionals, either -- I receive commentary on the <a href="http://fromthepage.com/JuliaBrumfield">Julia Brumfield Diaries</a> via email from people without high school degrees, who have no professional reputation to protect.</p>
