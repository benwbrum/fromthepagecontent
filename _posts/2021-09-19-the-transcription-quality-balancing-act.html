<p>We're often asked about the quality of crowdsourced transcription projects by people skeptical that amateurs can edit historic documents.&nbsp; Of course we're confident that amateurs can do high-quality work--especially in active collaboration with professionals--or else we wouldn't be doing this.&nbsp; But many questions remain.</p>
<h2>What is "quality"?</h2>
<p>While writing the first draft of the <a href="https://britishlibrary.pubpub.org/pub/working-with-crowdsourced-data/release/2#fidelity">quality control section of&nbsp;<em>The Collective Wisdom Handbook</em></a>, Austin Mast and I spent a lot of time discussing the different dimensions of quality.&nbsp; Austin divides what we think of as "quality" into <strong>fidelity</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>accuracy</strong>, which the <em>Handbook</em> differentiates this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Fidelity is the digital representation of an object following project guidelines. A transcription project might ask the participant to type the letters <em>as written</em> in the image of a page or label. If the page reads “30 m east from the wharf” and the contributor types out “30 meters east from the wharf” or “20 m east from the wharf,” both would represent reduced fidelity.&nbsp; <em>[...]</em>&nbsp; Accuracy is correspondence with generally agreed-upon reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Fidelity and accuracy often conflict in transcription projects: if a name is misspelled, a "faithful" transcription reproduces the spelling, but an "accurate" transcription corrects it.</p>

Fidelity requires "Issac", but accuracy might require "Isaac".[/caption]</p>
<p>The overwhelming practice among transcription projects is to value fidelity to a document over accuracy.&nbsp; If a genealogist complains that an original record misspelled their ancestor's name, the record will very rarely be updated.&nbsp; Most people running online databases consider them <em>indexes to records</em>, rather than <em>indexes to people</em>.&nbsp; Prioritizing fidelity gives a clear way to judge arguments; if one researcher insists a historical persons middle name was "Tyler" while another insists the name was "Terry", the archivist need not arbitrate between them, but can transcribe the name as written.&nbsp; In the example above, it's possible that "Issac" was an error typing the name "Isaac", but "Issac" is also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issac">real name.</a>&nbsp; Without other knowledge about Andrew Hembree's middle-name, a strict policy of fidelity to the document keeps us from guessing.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Type words exactly as they are written in the document. This includes capitalization, abbreviations, names, dates, and even misspelled words. If you happen to find a misspelled name, place, or event within the record, we encourage you to add a tag or a comment with the correct spelling of the word. This will ensure that the record is returned in a search result for that person, place, or event." —<a href="https://www.archives.gov/citizen-archivist/transcribe/tips">Transcription Tips</a>, <em>Citizen Archivist Dashboard</em>.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Fidelity versus usability</h2>
<p>The problem with strict "type what you see" policies is that they may produce high-fidelity results that are unusable.&nbsp; This is especially apparent when transcribing text that has a limited number of accurate answers, like place names in vital records or census forms.&nbsp; The value of preserving variant spellings of names of counties, provinces, or states seems limited (outside of toponym history projects), and might even be counterproductive.&nbsp; If the goal of a project is to create a database of records segmented by county, variant county names will need to be reconciled against a controlled vocabulary before the segmentation takes place.&nbsp; If this effort is postponed until after documents are transcribed and exported, staff doing the reconciliation may not have the context of the original images.</p>
<p>In practice, most indexing projects prioritize <em>accuracy</em> for some fields--using drop-down select lists for place names or other controlled vocabularies--but prioritize <em>fidelity</em> for others by asking users to type exactly what they see. It's a balancing act that ensures high-quality transcriptions that are also usable, and lets the person who is looking at a document image reconcile what is written to standard forms.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Unless the project instructions and field help say otherwise (and they often do!), correct misspellings of place-names.&nbsp; However, this general rule does not apply to the spelling of personal names. Since it is difficult to know whether a person's name is actually misspelled, you should typically index a person's name as it appears on the record."&nbsp; —<a href="https://www.familysearch.org/help/helpcenter/article/how-should-i-index-incorrect-records">How should I index incorrect records?</a>, <em>FamilySearch Indexing</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Among projects hosted on FromThePage, we tend to see documentary editions and research libraries prioritize fidelity in full-text transcription projects.&nbsp; State archivists and quantitative researchers tend to prioritize usability in field-based or spreadsheet projects.&nbsp; Each project finds a balance, and there is no single right answer.</p>
