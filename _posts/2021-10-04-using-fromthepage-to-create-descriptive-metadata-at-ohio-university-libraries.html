  _yoast_wpseo_metadesc: Ohio University Libraries has an internal staff project that
    uses FromThePage to generate transcriptions and descriptive metadata for a collection
    of dance posters. This project is a hybrid project, in that transcriptions are
    generated along with text from the posters captured through standardized metadata
    fields.

<p dir="auto"><a href="https://fromthepage.com/ohiouniversitylibraries">Ohio University Libraries </a>has an internal staff project that uses FromThePage to generate transcriptions and descriptive metadata for a collection of dance posters. This project is a hybrid project, in that transcriptions are generated along with text from the posters captured through standardized metadata fields. These fields allow the posters to be more accessible and findable by users, and allow users to find related posters based on the standardized fields. This project also has provided work for staff and students during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p dir="auto">Though the project is internal, Ohio University Libraries has provided screenshots to show their project setup on FromThePage.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the image below, you can see one of the posters in the library's collection on the left. This is a screenshot of the "transcribe" tab, where metadata and transcription data are filled in by the staff member. On the right, you can see the metadata fields the library has chosen to populate. In this case, some of the fields, like the "title" field, allow open text, but formatting instructions have been included on the interface as a helpful reminder for staff generating metadata. Other fields are dropdown selection fields with controlled vocabulary, which support the library in generating metadata that allows posters to relate to one another. A field towards the bottom, "Transcribed poster text," allows the transcription to be captured alongside descriptive metadata.</p>

<p dir="auto">The screenshot below is of another poster, but this time in the "overview" tab. Here, you can see the filled in metadata.</p>

<p dir="auto">How do you set up a project like this in FromThePage? Here's the field based transcription form builder that you can access as a project owner. This allows you create fields for your project and set parameters for these fields, such as limiting certain fields to a controlled vocabulary.</p>
