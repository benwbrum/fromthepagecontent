<p>What are the costs involved making FromThePage a going concern?  I see these five classes of costs:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>DNS</span></li>
<li>Initial hosting bills</li>
<li>Marginal hosting fees associated with disk usage, <span>cpu</span> usage, or bandwidth served</li>
<li>Labor by people with skills neither Sara nor I possess</li>
<li>Labor by people with skills that Sara or I do possess, but do not have time or energy to spend</li>
</ul>
<p>I can predict the first two with some degree of accuracy.  I've already paid for a domain name, and the hosting provider I'm inclined towards costs around $20/month.  When it comes to the cost of hosting other people's works for transcription, however, I have no idea at all what to expect.</p>
<p>I have started reading about start-up costs, and this week I listened to the <span>SXSW</span> panel "<span>Barenaked</span> App: The Figures Behind the Top Web Apps" (<a href="http://audio.sxsw.com/podcast/interactive/panel/2007/SXSW07.INT.20070312.TheFiguresBehindTheTopWebApps.mp3">podcast</a>, <a href="http://www.carsonified.com/sxsw.pdf">slides</a>).  What I find distressing about this panel is that the figures involved are so large: $20,000-$200,000 to build an application that costs $2000-$8000 per month for hardware and hosting!  It's hard to figure out how comparable my own situation is to these companies, since I don't even have a paid host yet.</p>
<p>This big unknown is yet another argument for a slow <span>rollout</span> â€” not only will alpha testers supply feedback about bugs and usability, the usage patterns for their collections will give me data to figure out how much an <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>-page collection with <span style="font-style: italic;">m</span> volunteers is likely to increase my costs.  That should provide about half of the data I need to decide on a non-commercial open-source model versus a purely-hosted model.</p>
