<p>I wanted to pass along some materials I think will be very relevant to setting up your crowd sourcing project and hiring your part time person to help with the project.  These resources are from our colleague Meghan Ferriter who runs the Smithsonian Transcription Center.</p>
<p>There's a new issue of <em>COLLECTIONS: A Journal for Museum and Archives Professionals</em> (Rowman &amp; Littlefield) which is focused entirely on the Smithsonian Transcription Center, released last week. You can find <a href="https://journals.rowman.com/issues/1017503-collections-vol-12-n2#product-details" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://journals.rowman.com/issues/1017503-collections-vol-12-n2%23product-details&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1485276657560000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE9KdUFY3VS4XuZxxsT3eVDa5_mpg">it electronically here</a>. Individual e-articles can be purchased for $3.99 USD.</p>
<p>The issue can also be purchased in print via <a href="https://rowman.com/page/JMAP" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://rowman.com/page/JMAP&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1485276657560000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHWUIMsQv9BKdfj27_uZRms_9RCgw">https://rowman.com/page/JMAP</a> (I believe for $12.50 USD).</p>
<p>I would recommend that you explore free sample chapters:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can view Courtney Bellizzi’s article “<a href="https://rowman.com/WebDocs/12.02Bellizzi.pdf" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://rowman.com/WebDocs/12.02Bellizzi.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1485276657560000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFjR4sdoVcmV2QqJvCUwyjGAQ92Bw">Planning and Storytelling with Collections</a>” - regarding preparing and integrating staff for the process of approving transcription. Although she is describing National Museum of African American History and Culture museum collections, it demonstrates forethought into managing staff commitments and generating buy-in on the process.</li>
<li>sample article is describing <a href="https://rowman.com/WebDocs/12.02Ferriter.pdf" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://rowman.com/WebDocs/12.02Ferriter.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1485276657560000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF-g7lEknts6g_uKP7URdsuznZU1w">Meghan's tasks and activities as Project Coordinator</a> (Her role is more commonly referred to as community manager.)</li>
</ul>
