<p>Using around 900 pages of Bentham material, a first HTR model was trained with very good results.  The ‘English Writing M1’ model can recognise pages written in a relatively neat hand by Bentham and his secretaries  with an impressive Character Error Rate (CER) of 5-10%.  This model is publicly available in <a href="https://transkribus.eu/Transkribus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transkribus</a> and can be applied to English handwriting from the 1800s and 1900s with nice results.</p>
<p>The Bentham Project is now working to improve the automated recognition of Bentham’s most difficult handwriting – written at a time when the philosopher was in his eighties and losing his sight.  Early results show a promising CER of 26%, which is a very good basis for keyword spotting as a research tool for scholars interested in Bentham’s ideas.</p>
