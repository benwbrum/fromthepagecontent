<p>About ten years ago, I wrote for a group blog called Horizon.&nbsp; Contributors came and went, but a core of us--mostly regulars from the alt.books.george-orwell usenet newsgroup--kept up a good conversation for three years.&nbsp; Sometime in the last fifteen months, the site went offline.&nbsp; Although we closed the doors five years ago, I didn't get a back-up and I wouldn't be surprised if none of my fellow bloggers did either.&nbsp; (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110716220753/http://horizon.bloghouse.net/archives/000979.html">Thank you, Internet Archive!</a>)</p>
