<p>Thanks for posting this correspondence.  I'm the early stages of a similar correspondence with <a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/">IATH</a> regarding the rights to <a href="http://www.iath.virginia.edu/mss/MTD.html">MTD</a>, and it's very helpful to track how yours has gone.</p>
<p>Regarding the irony of staking out copyright in order to share more freely, I discovered the opposite in regards to my blog and project.  A patent attorney friend of mine found out that I was blogging about the design and algorithmic elements of my software.  Surprised, he asked me if I intended to patent any of the system.  Upon my negative response, he told me that publishing details of the product could actually protect it from challenges by future patent-holders: the things I'm disclosing could establish prior art. </p>
<p>So while copyrighting your material allows you to share it, sharing mine allows me to protect it!</p>
