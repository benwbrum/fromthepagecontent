<p><em>Years after starting FromThePage, we realized it is fundamentally a documentary editing platform. As we've gone about educating ourselves on documentary editing -- and improving FromThePage with what we learned -- we've found some resources we think might be interesting to anyone running a transcription project, whatever their discipline.</em></p>

Franklin Jameson and others, arose on the edge of the profession, beyond it, or even on occasion, in spite of some obstacles thrown up from within it"; see "Some Animadversions on Being Struck by Lightning," Daedalus, 86 (1955-57), 49-56 (p. 50).</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>He also has stated, "That a mastery of the techniques and uses of scholarly editing is not now regarded as part of the indispensable equipment of the academic historian and as being a recognizable aspect of his duty is beyond question," and he points out that many people regard "the editorial presentation of documents as being almost mechanical in nature"; see "Historical Editing in the United States: The Next Stage?", Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society, 72 (1962), 309-328 (pp. 314-315).</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Lester Cappon, in "A Rationale" (see note 10 above), also speaks of "the academic historian's prejudice against editing as a second class pursuit"--a view in which the editor "appears to be a lone wolf, a kind of `sport' detached from the mainstream of teaching, engaged in a task that is useful but nevertheless expendable" (pp. 58-59).</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Such comments as these could be applied to the literary field as well; on the general lack of understanding of editing, see also note 80 below. Occasionally one hears the opposite point of view: Leo Marx, in "The American Scholar Today," Commentary, 32 (1961), 48-53, is bothered by "a suspicion that the scholar-editor is in fact the type we encourage and reward beyond all others" (p. 49); but his misunderstanding of editing is revealed by his labeling the editor a "humanist as-technician" (p. 50). In the historical field, it may be noted, there has been a greater tradition of the full-time editor, independent of academic responsibilities, than in the literary field.</p></blockquote>
