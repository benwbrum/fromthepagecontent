<p>It's about one o'clock. So I don't know what's coming in behind us if anything. So I think we ought to just get started. Thanks a lot for coming out. I'll try to get quickly to introducing Ben. And I guess I'll just begin with stating something obvious. And that is that crowd sourcing is not, in fact, new. In the 19th century, great scholars produced, for example, just to pick one of many, great volumes containing great many editions of inscriptions carved on stone in Greek and Latin throughout the ancient world. Tens of thousands of these things they published in relatively short order. What in fact this meant was sending armies of undergrads and grad students and other forms of indentured labor out into the field to transcribe these materials so that the great professor could put his name on the mast head and publish the book.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Josh:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>They didn't call this crowd sourcing, though in fact, that's what it was. They also didn't call this exploitation, which isn't surprising, but neither do we. And that's a little bit surprising. Well, whether for good or ill, professors no longer, at least on the humanities side for sure, meaning the parts of them I know about, no longer can call on armies of indentured junior scholars to go out and do this kind of work for them or toward their own, I should say. And thanks to the work of innovators like Ben Brumfield, who is not the guy who is a reporter for CNN, we're now not only able to collaborate with ambitious and intelligent and highly active amateur transcribers and editors, but we're actually able to give them the credit for the work that they do, which is a step up from the tradition we've inherited. And more importantly, we're able to start changing the broader culture that sees this kind of work as mere labor, rather than valuable and meaningful contributions to the sum of knowledge.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield took his BA in computer science and linguistics. This must be a double major in languages from Rice University in 1997. He's been a professional software developer since then. For about the last eight years or so, he's been developing an application that some of you may have seen called From the Page, getting more and more into the digital humanities space and the crowd sourcing space, particularly with regard to transcriptioning and [inaudible 00:02:41] edition making, which we'll talk about today. The term of art for this is of course seeing the light, or seeing less of the dark, I guess. So that's the last eight years. For the last 30 hours, he's been locked up in our space down the hall, helping to set up From the Page install here locally, which we've already started testing against a really fantastic 19th century travel diary in Rubenstein. And eventually, we're going to test it also on a number of Byzantine manuscripts in the Rubenstein collection. Which is what it [inaudible 00:03:17] could result in tears, crying meltdown above code and personnel. It will hear us.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Josh:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But in fact, the application has already been used on important drafts of literary authors of whom you've heard, military diaries, herpetologists, field notes and punk rock fanzines. And so you think the next step up that ladder, in fact, has to be Byzantine liturgical manuscripts. There's really nowhere to go after that. And likewise for all of us, there's nowhere to go but to sit before Ben, whom I'm very happy to introduce to all of you today.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Thank you very much. Thanks Josh, and thanks to Duke University Libraries and the DC3 for having me here. I'd like to just give sort of an introductory overview of how crowd sourcing projects work and the kinds of things that I've seen across disciplines, across institutions and kinds of organizations. For some of you this may be very new. For some of you, like Lisa Gregory over there, you may have actually run projects like this yourself. So let's get started. So I'd like to talk about what transcription is. We're all dealing with problems of, most of us are dealing with problems of digitization and the problem of computers being unable to read, essentially to [inaudible 00:04:51] our handwritten materials. But there's really two kinds of transcription, two kinds of activities that get labeled under the name of transcription. One of them is one that genealogists in particular but also sometimes natural scientists call it indexing.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>With indexing kinds of transcription, you're looking at structured data. Here we have a census entry from 1860, from a couple of counties north of here. It is structured. The goal of a transcription process is to extract names and other kinds of data from this text, and usually to create databases that are searchable. This is the kind of thing that you are going to print out and read and vet, right? This is something that you're going to want to have some sort of searchable interface to pull things out. There's a lot of interesting things you can do with this. Because the individual elements are small, you can apply fine grain quality control to them. You can also quantify people's contributions and use that to incentivize or dis-incentivize if it's done perfectly, imperfectly for gamification.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>By contrast, the editing approach to transcription is one of which you're dealing with diaries like this one, which is the one that we've been working with. This is a travel diary from 1849 from a Viscountess who was traveling around Smyrna in this case. And it's actually really interesting narrative. It's kind of hard to extract information out of it. But on the other hand, representing the entire text is really interesting and really useful. This is the kind of thing that you'd want to print out and read in bed. Normally this is done not through computational... You don't do quality control through computational methods, you have more of a traditional editorial work flow for creating these editions. And sometimes, you might actually want to print them out.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So if those are the two kinds of transcription activities, let's talk about the kinds of people who are doing these transcription activities. Crowd search transcription as a methodology, because it's a methodology, has really evolved independently in about six different communities, all of whom feel like they came up with the idea on their own. So let's talk about those communities and the kind of projects they're doing. So the first one I want to talk about is libraries and archives. So if you are in a library and you have invested a lot of work into producing high quality scans of digital facsimiles, you'd face a problem, which is, "Now what?". Right? The problem with this image is no one is going to read it. No one is going to find it, because Google cannot index it, because this is not text to Google. This is not text to Soar in your institutional repository, these are pixels. And transforming that into text that can be findable means that you offer a lot more value to your patrons and you can engage with people better.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In fact right now, a transcription project I'm working on, working with my great, great grandmother's diaries, my top volunteer, the person who has done the most work this year, is someone who is unrelated to the diarist, does not live in the community, knows no one in the family. He was doing a vanity search for his name, "Matt [Witting 00:08:19]" in Google. And what are the first results? Well all the mentions of a Matt Witting in these diaries. He read a little bit more and discovered, "Hey, that's my great uncle!" The diarists mail man. And now whenever he has a bad day at work, he goes through it, he transcribes the 1923 diary. He's just finished October this year. So I'm really excited. That's the kind of connection. This is the kind of serendipity that we get in the digital age through search engines of people making connections they wouldn't otherwise make, and they would not necessarily make through finding aids and subject headings and traditional cataloging practices. So the kind of materials that [inaudible 00:08:57] archives are working with, OCRed newspaper articles, we're not going to get into OCRed very much, hand written letters, again shooting for findability, and usually the format of your transcriptions are plain search transcripts, to be crawled by search engines to be searched by their indexes in their finding aids.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Okay. By contrast, documentary editors have also turned to crowd search transcription as a way to offload some of the burden, the initial transcription burden of this first step in the process of producing an edition. This is Transcribe Bentham, which is a project at University College London that is seeking to transcribe about 40,000 unpublished pages of Jeremy Bentham's papers. They created a media working interface that has volunteers who go through and transcribe his handwriting. It's really hard to read and there's a really complex set of mark up that they are asking their volunteers to do. To record all the changes that are made to these texts. You see there are places where he's crossed through elements, he's added elements, he's added marginalia, and they're getting their volunteers to capture all of that. So what editors are doing the best, they are looking for high quality digital editions, which means something a little bit more than plain text transcripts. And the format that they're usually going for is TEI or some even more obscure variants of XML. Their goal, again, [inaudible 00:10:34] are going to be digital editions and sometimes print editions.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Okay. So, genealogists. This is a register from... In fact, this is a burial register from a parish in England that is being transcribed by a group called FreeReg, who I work with. They are a group of volunteers dedicated to putting the records of baptisms, marriages and burials for England and Wales from 1538 through 1836 online, searchable, for free. They've been working on this for about 15 years now, mostly offline. Putting CD ROMs in the Royal Post. And they've entered 26 million of these. They're only about 10% done, so there's a lot more to do. So these genealogy communities, they're again starting with hand written records. They're again looking for findability, but they're looking for findability specifically for names and dates and places. So they're dealing with very structured data. Their goal is to produce things that can be found via their own internal search engines on their websites. So they're creating searchable databases.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>All right. So if you're in the natural sciences, this is what a text looks like to you. This is an image that has been digitized from your collections. Now you want to do something with this. This is an entomology specimen from the Calbug bug project. And in order to make this thing findable, you need to record the collector name. You need to record what the specimen is. You need to record who identified it and where they found it. And then you can do interesting things, not only to increase the findability of the specimens in your collections, but you can also map the collections. You can look at a certain species and say, "Where was this species collected? Is that species still there, or has habitat destruction or climate change affected it?"</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So in this case, what they're shooting for is analysis. And they're dealing with structured data, but they're dealing with visually very complex structured data. Let me tell you, the legs on an insect confuse OCR software to no end, because they look like letters. But the guesstimate is essentially museum professionals and scientists who are going to be analyzing this data and producing it in scientific journals.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Okay. This is ProPublica, which is a use of crowd source transcription in investigative journalism. One of the best example of this was the MP expenses scandal in the UK about three years ago, in which it was found that a number of members of parliament were using government funds to build lines and ponds and other sort of personal things. So they filed their equivalent of a freedom of information act request. This is The Guardian newspaper, and got millions and millions of scans of receipts. Now what? So they enlisted members of the public, activists essentially, to come online and flag these kinds of receipts. Many printed, many hand written. In this case, this is [inaudible 00:13:58]. This is an example of trying to track down campaign contributions and gifts in the United States. So they're looking for receipts for different kinds of things. And the goal is to direct the attention of reporters to things that they may need to do research on, that they may want to write articles on that the public is really interested in. Again in this case, we're dealing with structured data.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So the role of free cultures, specifically the Wikipedia world, and also to come extent Project Gutenberg, has also been working with crowd source transcription. This is Wikisource, the journal language of Wikisource, which is a sister project to Wikipedia. It's actually an offshoot of Wikipedia that was started around 2004. And they pretty rapidly started trying to do OCR correction. Because the communities disagree with each other and have different policies, only the German language Wikipedia, oh sorry, Wikisource, started projects that allow people to transcribe manuscripts. Everyone else, because of the fear that Wikisource's credibility would be ruined and turned into a platform for pranks to [inaudible 00:15:12] materials. Everyone else required any kind of materials posted to have previously been printed on paper. But the journalists led the way. Nowadays the National Archives and Records Administration is collaborating with Wikisource and the United States to put some of their hand written materials online and there are a number of small archives in France that are doing the same thing with the French language Wikisource.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Again, their origins are OCR because of the print aspect of this. They're looking for readability and they are doing traditional data validations. Okay. So if those are the institutions that are working with this, who are the actual volunteers who are participating in these projects? So this is an analysis that was done by the Portal of Texas History, that I think is pretty representative. It certainly matches what citizen science projects have found, which is that your median volunteer on any one of these crowd sourcing projects is going to be a 60 year old woman with a master's degree. This is the core of your volunteers. This can be kind of surprising, but it turns out that these are self selecting samples. If you're someone who's really worried about the quality of your contributors, this is [inaudible 00:16:27]. If you're someone who's worried about serving traditionally underserved populations this is bad news. But this is the kind of people we're talking. THere's some variations. Military history tends to draw more men, astronomy tends to draw people who are old and younger. On average, 60 year old women with master's.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So why do they do it? So this is a project, it's one of my absolute favorite citizen science projects, which si the USGS North American Bird Phenology Program. This is a citizen science project that is digitizing the records of a 19th century citizen science project. So from the 1870's, up until around, it kind of veers off around the 1930s. The USGS encouraged bird watchers to send their observations about individual species and individual locations into the Patuxent Bay Research Center. So nowadays, we're interested in climate change. We're interested in how to [inaudible 00:17:31]. Particularly interested in when do birds start their migrations? How does that compare with when they started their migrations a hundred years ago? All we have to do is transcribe two, I think, and a half million index cards that are in these filing cabinets. So we have volunteers who are doing this and they're doing it well. Some volunteers actually have transcribed as many as 200,000 index cards on their own. It's really impressive in that they're producing some [inaudible 00:18:07] stuff.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The people running this, Jessica Zelt, at the USGS, ran a survey of their volunteers saying, "Why do you participate? Why do you contribute?" So there's some really interesting things going on here. One of them is people say, "This si important." And it's true. One of the reasons people participate in these projects is because they want to do something meaningful with their lives. Especially if you're a retiree, you don't want to sit around and play games all the time. You want to do something that matters. But the other thing that's going on here is they say, "Love of nature." Why is love of nature one of the things that motivates somebody to sit in front of their computer and type up records here? Well, this gets to the immersive nature of transcription. If you are transcribing a document, doesn't matter what it is, this is deep reading. You are reading, character by character, line by line. And when I try this, I'm not a birder. I don't know anything. I'm just interested in the tool. In fact, I've started transcribing a few of these book scraps. I wasn't sitting in front of my computer anymore. I was with these guys. Somewhere in a march in Minnesota, typing up the results of our day's observations. And this is a lot of what's motivating people intrinsically to participate in things.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Okay. So what about accuracy? And how is the relationship of who's participating and how they're participating within this? The best studies of this have been done by the Citizen Science Alliance, the Zooniverse project. And my favorite example of their projects is one called Old Weather. Again, for scientists studying climate change, the problem isn't pointing a weather telescope at some point of the Earth's surface to find out how the climate is now. The problem is that you can't point a telescope at the South Pacific and see what the weather was like in 1914. If we want to see how the climate has changed, we have to find out what the climate used to be like. Fortunately, most of the world's maize, remember you're going [inaudible 00:20:21], has someone who every four hours, would go and make a weather observation. So the office of their watch would come out and write latitude and longitude and time of day and wind speed, wind direction, water temperature and air temperature. This is great! All we have to do is transcribe all of the weather observations of all the log books of the Royal Navy.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So they have volunteers who did this. And in fact, they've moved on to Noah's ark cruises now, because they're done with all of the Royal Navy for all of World War One. So they got through 1 to 1.6 million weather observations, with 16,000 volunteers who transcribed 400 million log pages. Which means you have a mean contribution of a hundred transcriptions per volunteer. But that's not what actually happened! This statistic is totally worthless. If you look at this graph, what we have over here is a plot with one pixel per contribution and one rectangle per volunteer. And if you see, most people have one pixel down here. THere's this enormous group of people who transcribed one thing and then left. But by contrast, over a tenth of the weather observations are made by these eight people alone. So they're going through and doing this, hour after hour, day after day. It's an important part of their lives. So what does that mean? So that's a power law distribution, in which the contributions, if you graph the contributions by user, you'll see that a tiny minority make most of the contributions and the next bracket down make a fraction of those and odd.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>And we have found this true regardless of project size. I have seen this happen with projects that have five volunteers. I have seen this happen with projects that have tens of thousands of volunteers. So what are the implications of this power law distribution? One of the things that I feel like this implies or addresses is it addresses a really common objection to crowd sourcing, which is that the crowd is not capable of doing scholarly work, or contributing to scholarly projects. They're not capable, they're not interested. But would you look at the person sitting next to you at a red light and you think, "They can't do this."? But those aren't the people you're asking. So here are some typical objections. One of my favorite examples of this was a scholar who was violently opposed to the idea of allowing volunteers to translate letters of a famous composer from German into English. All right. Well, you know classical music fans, a lot of them have pretty good command of German. That would be my perspective. But he said, "There's no way we can ask the public to to do this!"</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>South Carolina voted for New Cambridge, because they can't do this. Well, this is a total non sequitur. That's not actually what's going on. So what's actually going on is with these crowd sourcing projects is you're casting this net, a pretty wide net to gather a few really well informed amateurs. These well informed enthusiasts who love the material, they know what they're doing and they have no other institutional or organizational connection to it. And I saw this with one of the first collaborations I did with a library. This is the Zenas Matthews diary, which is the diary of a Texas volunteer in the Mexican-American war. It is held at the special collections of the Smith Library, Southwestern University of Georgia and I was looking for this online [inaudible 00:24:22] from the page with [inaudible 00:24:23]. And we get the thing out in New York. And we don't actually announce it yet. So we're going back and forth and we say, "How should we craft the announcement? What should we do about help text?" And meanwhile someone writes them and says, "Hey I'm really interested in Texas, and I'm looking for this diary from 1836."</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>And we're all kind of excited, and Catherine reads this and says, "Okay! 1836, right? Here it is." And he responds and says, "No, no, no, no. This is not what I'm looking for, but yeah I'll check this out." So [inaudible 00:24:54]. So we go back to talking about what should we do about phones and announcements and he goes through and in two weeks, he transcribes the entire 43 page diary. This diary is not in good condition. And when he finishes transcribing, he starts doing research and adding foot notes. So these are foot notes added by Scotty Patrick, who is a retired oil field worker with a high school education outside of Houston, Texas, who's gone through and looked at the people who are mentioned in this diary and he says, "Here's this person. He goes on to become a [inaudible 00:25:29]. By the way, he's my cousin. He recognizes the phonetic spelling that Zenas Matthews, this Texas volunteer had of elements that he's running into in Mexico. He says, "Oh well, this is actually a refined sugar."</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But he goes and he finds books that are mentioned very briefly and sends us links to them. So in fourteen days, he transcribes the entire diary. He goes back and makes 250 revisions to the transcript, because as he becomes comfortable with the hand, he goes back to earlier pages and says, "Oh that was a 'w' angle but that means this isn't just a straight through thing," and creates two dozen foot notes. So these really are ideal well informed enthusiasts. It leaves us wondering what we're going to announce publicly now that he's done. But it was really an experience. So let's talk about quality. There are really two different ways that these kinds of projects implement quality control over user contributions. And they go back to that distinction I was talking about earlier, between the editing approach and the indexed approach. Between the structured data that's highly granular and the free form data that really requires a more human approach. So I [inaudible 00:26:49] these into a three way process that has a single track which is used for editing purpose. And of which, start with an image, a volunteer or a number of volunteers transcribes, produces a transcript, makes a number of revisions to that transcript and then it's approved [inaudible 00:27:08] in some sense.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On contrast, these other smaller projects that are happening in genealogy and citizen science have what I call a multi [inaudible 00:27:18] approach in which the multiple volunteers who are keying in the same information independent of each other, unaware that the other is doing this. So you may have heard multiple transcripts that are then compared against each other programmatically and either merged or reconciled or rejected. So in this case, we made two transcripts, checked to see if they're the same, because they are very simple single line elements it's easy for computers to do that without worrying about accidental purposes. And if they are the same, we can approve them. If they're not, we send them on for further processing. So look at some examples. Wikisource. Every page in Wikisource goes through states. They start off blank. They need a transcript. Then someone transcribes them. They grab multiple revisions. And so this work is ready to be proof read. You have a proof reader who comes in and either accepts or says, "This needs correction." Sends it back to transcribe. It's again proof read once. Second proof reader comes in and checks and either rejects it or accepts it. [inaudible 00:28:33] the page is locked down. When every page in Wikisource of a work is locked down and proof read twice, then the whole thing is considered done.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>By contrast, Family Search Index, which is a genealogy program which is asking volunteers to transcribe things like census ledgers. This is the tool that was used for the 1940 census in which you had a billion records that were entered by volunteers. What they do is they present the same image to two people. Those two people produce two transcripts of the image, gain with the comparison algorithm. [inaudible 00:29:15]. And then the interesting thing about this is that if the comparison algorithm says that these two things are off, meaning they're not the same, there's something funny, they're presented to someone called a reconciler who is, sorry, an arbitrator, who is another volunteer. That volunteer is presented with the original image, presented with both transcripts and then basically it is up to them to select one of them or create their own. So the interesting thing about this is how do you find these volunteer arbitrators? When you've got hundreds of thousands of volunteers, that's a lot of staff work. Well, they do this emergent system, where if you're a volunteer transcriber and you have either always typed the same thing again as another person, or you went to arbitration and won, then they say, "You're pretty good. You've got a score of this much, we're going to invite you in." And they teach classes on this, they actually have full work shop sessions for arbitrators themselves, which [inaudible 00:30:22].</p>

<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Another approach is the one taken by Old Weather. They start off with the same image and they do blind triple key. Originally, they did blind ten way key. They were getting 10 transcripts of every single weather observation. They did some math and discovered that triple key was actually just as good from a volume perspective and certainly accelerated their process. So there it makes the three copies, they present them to a comparison algorithm and they're the same, it's great. Goes under their analytical database. If they're not the same, they essentially have the three transcripts vote and if two of them match, "Yay, that one works!" If they're not the same, they all get referred to processing.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So they have an interesting side effect of this learning algorithm, which is that if you're outvoted consistently, a secret field on your user record, recording your quality, is updated. So this goes on your transcript, essentially. So they've also run statistics on their accuracy. And I think that these are really interesting. So if you just look at the individual transcripts that are produced, about 97% of them are accurate.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>That doesn't mean that the transcribers are messing up 3% of the time. In fact, the transcribers are messing up 0.3% of the time, in which there's something very clear, the typed the wrong thing. 1% of the time, the actual original observation is completely illegible. There's nothing, there's no information that could be derived from that. And the other interesting thing that I think calls into question this measure of accuracy is that just as many observations that are mistyped by the transcriber and are wrong because of that, that same number are wrong because the officer of the watch confused East and West. So they observed this when they started geo-coding and plotting all these observations of things that had passed all their arbitration and voting. They're plotting these ships and suddenly a ship ends up in the middle of Afghanistan. And all right, okay, North, South, plus, minus. And so the actual errors are the law.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Okay. So I'd like to talk about a couple of specific projects to talk about costs and results and the components of their costs. These were a couple of my favorite projects, and they're very different. One of them is a shoe string operation, the other one is a project that has extensive institutional support and a three digit, a six digit budget. So the first one is the Harry Ransom Center of Manuscript Fragments Project. So the Ransom Center is an institution [inaudible 00:33:25] that's known for its collection of [inaudible 00:33:26]. If you want to know about the progress, it's [inaudible 00:33:31] Ransom Center. They have a whole lot of money to do collections [inaudible 00:33:36] and sometimes they end up with books that are not modernist, old books, including books that are bound with fragments of manuscript, of medieval manuscripts that were used, just a little waste. They were sliced up and used for binding. So what they started doing, and this is specifically Micah Erwin, a junior archivist there, is that he started taking photographs of this manuscript, these manuscript fragments and posting them on Flickr and asking, "Anybody know who this is? Where this came from?"</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>And in the comment threads, you have people who are transcribing and identifying what they are. So here you have Adam006 who says, "Oh you know what? This is what this is. I'm on a [inaudible 00:34:25] and I transcribed the text, I did a search and Google Books and Google Scholar and I found an edition and identified this as the fragments of Podesta." And he also says, "I think the script's probably 14th century from Italy. You have someone else who is a grad student who elaborates even more and the student [inaudible 00:34:47] to find this. This is pretty impressive, for a Flickr comment thread. Here's another example, of which we have three fragments that are used to bind a cover onto a book. Then we have a comment by [inaudible 00:35:03], who if I remember correctly is a retired rare book dealer who describes exactly what each one of these fragments are and transcribes them as well.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So the Manuscript Fragments Project has a capital budget of nothing. All the images were taken with a camera phone, then directly uploaded to Flickr. Their software development budget was also zero. They have a Flickr account. At some point, I understand they paid the 25 bucks to convert it to a pro account, but that's all. In terms of staffing, this is really minimal. Originally, this was entirely done as a volunteer project by the archivist in his spare time. He had no institutional support. After it started getting a little bit of press, the Ransom Center said, "This is kind of cool. You could do this on the clock." But really still pretty minimal. If you look at their results, roughly a quarter of your fragments are still unidentified, of which probably half are considered certified identifiable. They're just too small, they're too faint, they're too damaged. Volunteers identified of these, more than 50, which is really impressive. They identified them on Flickr. There's something else that's kind if interesting going on, which is that other scholars started calling in. Now they didn't participate on the Flickr message boards. They didn't comment there. But they would make phone calls into the Ransom Center and say, "Hey, I just saw you posted this thing. And in this case, they're using the same platform used for crowd sourcing, not participating in it, but using the same mechanism of distributing the challenge of identifying these things.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As a result, they've got a really impressive following in terms of the... They've got an impressive social media presence as well as going from having no manuscript fragments described and collected in their database to most of them. So this is Micah's comment about the outreach. And I don't know what the answer is. How does outreach matter? I don't know. We don't know again. But previously, medievalists knew nothing of the Ransom Center because there's nothing for medievalists there. Now they're kind of hung up. In retrospect, they asked Micah, "What would you have done differently?" And he said that he really regretted not engaging with he volunteers more. And this gives to something that I always warn people about in crowd sourcing projects, which is that crowd sourcing is not about free labor. It is not about getting volunteers to do your work for you for nothing. We have this saying in open source software, "Free as in beer, versus free as in speech." Crowd sourcing is really kind of free as in puppy. People will come out and they will participate and they will help you out, but they do it for their own reasons and they require some engagement with you. They don't require being paid! That's not why they're doing it, but you need to acknowledge their contributions and make sure the contributions you give them are important.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The other [inaudible 00:38:22] I'd like to talk about is [inaudible 00:38:25], which is a project by the City Archive of Leuven Belgium that goes back to, they have registers that go back to the 1400s that basically are a record of the city court, the town [inaudible 00:38:43]. I saw one that was this woman was accused of selling leather in a market without a guild stamp on it. And she was sentenced to go on pilgrimage to this nearby shrine and was not to be admitted back in the city unless she has the bag, the medallion from that shrine. So that's the kind of material. It's really interesting but it's written in 15th century Dutch. So you've got the linguistic issue of Middle Dutch, you've got the other [inaudible 00:39:12] issue of this being really hard to read, and you also have some interesting text and coding issues, of editions and the regions that they want to capture. They started this project three and a half years ago and this differs a lot from the Ransom Center project. In this case, they're doing all of the digitization. They have volunteers involved here every step. The volunteers are going through an evaluating the physical registers for conservation. They're doing some minimal conservation themselves for their past registers for professional conservation.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The volunteers are operating a $40,000 image photography system. They are capturing the images themselves. And this was after some experimentation deemed to be more cost effective and higher quality than outsourcing the digitization. I can tell you some of the horror stories I've heard about that later. Out of those images, archival copies versus access copies are all created and reviewed by volunteers. Similarly, imaging problems are identified and so some things may need to be re-imaged. And then out of all of these, an act may span multiple pages, or there may be multiple acts of these courts on a page. They've gone through and transcribed about 12,000 of them. This has all been done with between 35 and 40 volunteers, most of whom are local, some of whom work on a web based tool from elsewhere, but they're mostly there in the town. And they're managed by one full time staff member and sliver of the main archivist's time. So what's their budget like? Their budget is pretty big. They're paying for roughly four person [inaudible 00:41:10] out of staff time. They're paying for a professional quality bug scanner. They're paying for this transcription software and for developing a tutorial to help people learn 15th century Dutch paleography.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>They have exhibits in the town hall and they've actually sponsored conferences on the subject. But the thing to realize about many of these projects that are these sort of tip to tail projects is that to some extent, the money that's being spent on imaging is not necessarily part of the crowd sourcing project. This is a criticism of transcribe [inaudible 00:41:45]. That it spent all this money doing work that if they just hired the editors to do it, they would've got more transcripts. Well yes, but two thirds of the money went to making digital facsimiles. Now should that really count? And that's an interesting question. So to wrap up, let me point you to other people who know lots about these. Mia Ridge is finishing her PhD at the Open University, and she is studying a crowd sourcing through cultural heritage, not just transcription. She and I are going to be co-teaching a class next summer at University of Maryland, just with their health program. We're working towards that. Chris Lindhoff speaks a lot. Doing web search for any of these people will find videos of which they present the details of their projects. Micah Erwin, running the Manuscript Fragments Project. [inaudible 00:42:40], Dominic [inaudible 00:42:42] Parks and Paul Clements at the University of Maitland Australia.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So let me wrap up, and we've got about 15 minutes left and ask the questions and I'll leave you with pointers to a few URL's. There's my own transcription tool, twitter page, there's a direct read of transcription software. The great thing about crowd source transcription tools is that there are [inaudible 00:43:10] of them to choose for, from the horrible things that the Australians can choose from. So there's a direct [inaudible 00:43:15]. So are there any questions? I see one hand up in the back, yes.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Liz Nolanson:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Hi. Hi Ben. I'm Liz [Nolanson 00:43:21], digital scholarship services here in the library. This is just fantastic. One of the things that you mentioned, you said you felt like people should spend more time on connecting with their volunteers and really reaching out to... That was what Micah had said if he could do it differently. What would they have done, or how would they have made a better or more long lasting relationship with their volunteers at work? Did you talk more about that outreach? It seems to me that's really critical for getting the work done but it's not really well understood how to get them and continue to keep them engaged.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Right. So there's really three aspects of that. Ne of them is finding volunteers. And one suggestion I've made at times is before you start a transcription project, if you're looking at crowd sourcing a collection of bicycle photos, versus crowd sourcing a set of civil war diaries, versus something else, is don't start with he digitization, the software development. Start by identifying online communities you can talk to. Because maybe there are lots of people, there are existing forums of enthusiasts of the Spanish-American war. Maybe there's not. You can find this out before you invest a penny. So really almost the first step is identifying ways to publicize those kinds of material. Another step is if you're already well know, again, reaching out to your patrons who make inquiries, as we did with Southwest University and Scotty Patrick. In terms of engagement, being there and answering. One of the things that the Benford people will tell you has really hurt them is that they closed down for the holidays.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So when the New York times published an article covering the Ben [inaudible 00:45:07] Transcription Project [inaudible 00:45:09]. On December 23rd, they had a flood of inquiries, a flood of people who answered who emailed them saying, "How do I get involved?" And when they didn't get back to them for two and a half weeks, they lost potential people. And the last thing I would say, and one thing of which I feel libraries are very well suited for wanting these, as opposed to some other kinds of organizations is to realize that you're building these communities organically.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One of the things that really hurt the Transcribe Benford people is that they were given a one year grant. They had six months to develop the software, they had five months to run the project and then one month to write up the results. So they develop the software for half a year, they made the announcement, they attracted these really committed volunteers and then after five months they said, "Pencils down!" And talking to Melissa Terris, their really active volunteers, a lot of them felt betrayed and did not come back when they were able to get more funding and continue, because they said, "So all right, this is over." Whereas something that is part of an organization that can see this as multi [inaudible 00:46:29] year, open ended projects, or perhaps something that only starts off with fewer than 40,000 depths [inaudible 00:46:37] something that's achievable has, I think, an advantage in running things.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Josh:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Can I answer that real quickly? So one of the things that we've done is just spend insane amounts of time emailing people, about their health, about all kinds of things, as if they were our friends, which they become. And another thing we do, and this sounds a little counter-intuitive, is sometimes we urge people to back off a little bit to not get burnt out. And if there are bugs that we're working on in the software, we say, "Take a break for a couple of days. Let us work this out, rather than you get frustrated, because they're normal people that, well sort of, and what happens... And they can cross that line, where they start to resent the thing that initially they love. And so, you just have to develop this relationship with them that takes extraordinary amounts of time but it's worth it for the value at the end. That's our statement.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Yes. Any other questions?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Speaker 4:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Just an observation. Flickr, as you know, now gives away a terabyte of information. So in the old days when they had to pay $25 to get unlimited, any organization now to anybody can have a terabyte of space to load pictures. So it's gotten even cheaper.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Yes. Hand there. Yes.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Speaker 4:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So we have to have everyone have an ID to vote, because of all the voter fraud. There is no voting fraud. We can't let people transcribe our staff results or that would be evil or whatever. Are there stories about malicious behavior that you could talk about or are there really no exemplars that you could talk about? And secondly, around that, I imagine transcribing weather or birds, very different than say, racialist views in the South during the civil war. And so, are there any crowd sourcing things that are around what might be considered hot button issues?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Those are two interesting questions. To address the first, the person who's done the most research on this is [inaudible 00:48:52] Harris. And if I can quote her, she would say, in her Scottish accent, "It just doesn't happen. It does not happen. Fundamentally, bored high school kids vandalize Wikipedia because everyone sees Wikipedia. And other than that, they have better things to do." That said, there are comment spam attacks on my side every day. They're extremely naïve. I require users to have an account in order to post a comment, and as a result, none of them succeed. So it doesn't actually take any time or me. But other then the spam box, there are no examples that I know of that of active malicious [inaudible 00:49:38].</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>And the second question, let's see, example. Okay so all of the citizen journalism, all the investigative journalism is dealing with hot button issues. They have people who are politically motivated. They are activists and that's why they're contributing to these projects. So I feel like those are really powerful and you might... I don't know of cases in which political opponents have gone and tried to mess things up. Could happen, I'm not sure. So, we'll see. Yes!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Liz Nolanson:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Hi. I'd like to comment related to that. You were [inaudible 00:50:22]. I'm curious about if there's aging between [inaudible 00:50:28] and the public. And then in the project that I'm working on, there is potential for there to be arguments between people who are looking at the same artifact. And so if that was contentious, is there [inaudible 00:50:42] happening in any of these different practices where it then becomes public and maybe law or is that also then becoming part of the deductive [inaudible 00:50:51].</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So a lot of people in, particularly in the archives and museum world ar every careful about incorporating user generated content back into their public presences. So those people will have a lot of this work be done privately and then accepted into an official place. Even if the end users don't care about the official place, they have a whole community of transcribers where they can discuss these things. By contrast, people in the citizen science world want to foster those kinds of discussions. And the Zooniverse group have created a tool called, "Talk," in which they graft this tool onto their transcription projects. So if someone notice something interesting, they can discuss it. And they can discuss it in a way that is linked to the image or the images as well as the transcripts that are relevant. And there's a second piece of this, which is a little bit to engagement, which is that part of their goal is to focus scientist's time on those discussions that are happening that have the most potential. So that if you are a scholar who only has two hours on Friday afternoon, you go to Talk, you see where the hot discussions are, and then you can go in and weigh in, reward those contributors, those volunteers, with a dialogue with a real scientist, which they're excited about.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You can see the provenance of the contribution of the discussion, as well as of the transcript, as well as of the facsimiles that are starting all this. So there's, I feel like, a couple of different approaches that are, like I say, at war with each other. But this idea of, "User generated content is great, let's just make sure that the authors are transparent," is not one that's accepted everywhere. Yes.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Liz Nolanson:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You mentioned that you were using one of the travel diaries. Can you just say, have you been transcribing or what are the [inaudible 00:53:09].</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Josh, do you want to explain?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Josh:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Yeah, sure. We set up upon this by accident. It's a travel diary of Emily Ann Beaufort Smythe Strangford of her travels through Greece and Turkey and Syria in 1859, 60. Her husband's father was Strangford the 6th, who was the donor of the Strangford collection in the British museum of antiquities purchased in Constantinople in the 1820s. And she herself traveled in the footprint of Greco-Roman antiquity in the ancient near East in the... When was that [inaudible 00:53:59]? [inaudible 00:53:59]?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Josh:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The published book.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ben Brumfield:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The published one, the published one was actually 1860, I want to say. It was right after the diary.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Josh:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So we have a published journal of her travels. But then we have here at Rubenstein that this account of her travels in 1859, 60, and we're only now five pages in... But one of the things we want to see is how well from the page works as a way of keeping the kind of value that library users bring to library materials when they come to special collections and transcribe things in their notebooks and then walk away, such that the minute they're gone, they know more about the material than the library does. But if they're able to transcribe, capture certain aspects of materials that we have via a simple tool that we can stand up and they can walk away, do what they like and we now know more about the thing. So we're playing with how well it works for hooking up people with places and times to standard services that control them. And one of the things that we think might be pretty cool is if we can build a visualization layer on top of the journal itself, so that we can watch her movement in space and see what places she's visited, what these towns used to be called and the extent to which... Since we also have the published volume fro archive.org, we might actually be able to see places where she has revisited. We don't know yet. We've been working on this for 31 hours now.</p>

<p>Well the library has much to its credit, with a high beautiful high quality digital image of every single page.</p>

<p>Right, it's part of the being concerned with [inaudible 00:56:12]. This is why I'm freaked about it. It's something that we could both work on.</p>

<p>Josh:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Yeah. Well, what you should do is just come see us and we'll give you the URL. We're playing with the transcription and you can play too.</p>

<p>Speaker 7:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You describe [inaudible 00:56:32] for targets and different [inaudible 00:56:36]. Would this front page archetype be one of those?</p>

<p>[crosstalk 00:56:41]. So my tool was built essentially for amateurs to produce their own print and digital editions. I created it for a set of diaries, because I've mentioned that they were family diaries. It allows people to do plain text transcripts but also to use a [inaudible 00:57:01] syntax to index terms of people, place, things like that. The people who seem most excited about that particular aspect of it are often in the natural history world that are museums, that are now looking from their specimens that they have back to their notebooks that were created by the collectors, because they're interested to contextualize those objects and those items with the conditions under which they were collected. So they're excited about that. The other people live, but mine is more traditionally for narratives. Letters, diaries, journals. The actual texts, as opposed to forward extracts. Are there any more questions? I think we're petty much out of time. I'd be happy to sit around and chat with anybody, but I don't want to keep you in your seats when you have other things to do.</p>
