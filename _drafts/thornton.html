<p>The amateur scribe Robert Thornton was the subject of a book of scholarly essays edited by <a href="https://www.kent.edu/english/profile/susanna-fein">Susanna Fein</a> and <a href="https://www.cla.purdue.edu/facultyStaff/profiles/promoted/promotions-14/Johnston._Michael.html">Michael Johnston</a> and published by Boydell &amp; Brewer (York Medieval Press) in 2014: <em><a href="https://boydellandbrewer.com/robert-thornton-and-his-books-hb.html">Robert Thornton and His Books: Essays on the Lincoln and London Thornton Manuscripts</a></em>. Professor Fein has graciously, along with the publishers, allowed us to create a hyperlinked version of the footnotes to the manuscripts' contents list from her chapter therein, "The Contents of Robert Thornton's Manuscripts." Our aim is to provide an online companion to this chapter for scholarly and student use.</p>
<p>This resource is provided freely and acts as, essentially, a hyper-linked bibliography intended to be used in conjunction with her chapter, cited above. As additional versions of these works are digitized and made available online (or indeed in print), we will update this article with the links. In this spirit of collaborative scholarship, we encourage you to let us know about any newly digitized works relevant to the Thornton manuscripts, either by leaving a comment below or <a href="mailto:support@fromthepage.com">emailing us</a>.</p>

Though the dates of his birth and death remain unconfirmed, he was active as an amateur scribe and compiler from 1418 to 1456, during which time he compiled two codices now known as the Lincoln Thornton (<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=UF22sBCbWtUC&amp;pg=PA46#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">1430-1440</a>, <a href="http://lincolncathedral.heritage4.com/HeritageScripts/Hapi.dll/retrieve2?SetID=1E43C18B-67E9-4A82-B4D2-792BC0F1AC79&amp;SearchTerm0=ms%2091&amp;SearchPrecision=20&amp;SortOrder=0&amp;Offset=2&amp;Direction=%2E&amp;Dispfmt=F&amp;Dispfmt_b=B27&amp;Dispfmt_f=F13&amp;DataSetName=HERITAGE">Lincoln Cathedral Library MS 91</a>) and the London Thornton (<a href="http://searcharchives.bl.uk/IAMS_VU2:IAMS032-002022830">British Library MS Additional 31042</a>). The Lincoln Thornton consists of 312 folios, 17 quires of varying numbers of sheets; some appear to have been read as pamphlets before later being bound together. The first grouping contains romances, the second religious works, and the third medical advice and recipes. Illustrations, mainly initials, appear throughout; there are also blank spaces for initials that were never added. Thornton signed both of these manuscripts, including multiple times in the Lincoln manuscript, as well as including "<i>R. Thornton dictus qui scripsit sit benedictus"</i> ("May the said R. Thornton who wrote this be blessed")<span class="ILfuVd yZ8quc">—</span>which appears four times in the Lincoln manuscript and once in the London manuscript (see Fein and Johnston, pages 19-20). The Lincoln Thornton was rediscovered in the 19th century (see Keiser), with various texts being published between 1866 and 1938. Derek Brewer and A.E.B. Owen published a facsimile in 1975 (updated and reprinted in 1977). A full list of the manuscript's contents can be found in Fein and Johnston, pages 21-48.</p>
<p>The London Thornton is shorter than the Lincoln, at 179 folios, and its contents are more homogeneous, consisting chiefly of religious works interspersed with secular lyrics and verse. John J. Thompson's 1987 book, <em>Robert Thornton and the London Thornton manuscript: British Library MS additional 31042,</em> provides the most thorough review of the manuscript. A full list of the manuscript's contents can be found in Fein and Johnston, pages 48-60, along with an exhaustive bibliography of scholarly examinations of both manuscripts.</p>
<p>A member of the landed gentry, Thornton was an amateur scribe in an era when virtually all scribes were professional, working either in royal courts or the church. The manuscripts he compiled and copied evidence broad literary interests, ranging from popular medieval literature<span class="ILfuVd yZ8quc">—</span>such as Arthurian romances and alliterative verse<span class="ILfuVd yZ8quc">—</span>to devotional works to a medical treatise. The Lincoln and London manuscripts contain the only surviving examples of many of the works included; a full index of manuscripts sharing items with the Thornton manuscripts can be found on pages 61-65 of Fein and Johnston. Both because of his status as an amateur, the rarity of the texts he preserved, and the fact that so many manuscripts were lost to King Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries between 1536 and 1541, Thornton's two compilations represent extremely rare examples of English late medieval private manuscript anthologies, providing a wealth of information to scholars. As Johnston explains in the introduction to <em>Robert Thornton and His Books</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>"...the value in sustained, focused, and collective analysis of Robert Thornton and his manuscripts lies in the amazing wealth of detail we can find--details about the compilation and scribal practices of an identifiable historical figure; about the diversity and contours of vernacular and Latin literary culture in a provincial fifteenth-century English locale; about one specific instantiation of lay piety; about one individual's understanding of literary genres and verse forms; about medieval medicinal beliefs and practices; about conceptions of illumination and decoration in the non-commercial book; about the book production industry in regions beyond London; and about the literary activities of the late medieval gentry."</p></blockquote>
